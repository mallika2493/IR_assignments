This is the readme file for IR assignment 2

Language: Python
Version: 2.7.10

Steps to run:

Task 1
G1.txt contains the graph G1
wt2g_inlinks.txt contains the graph G2
Task1.pdf contains the brief summary of statistics of sink node count and source node count for G1 and G2

Task 2
Run command: python page_rank_algorithm.py 
top_50_G1_results.txt contains the top 50 pages from G1 graph sorted in decreasing order of page rank values
top_50_G2_results.txt contains the top 50 pages from G2 graph sorted in decreasing order of page rank values
To obtain the G2 page rank results please change the filename to “wt2g_inlinks.txt” and run the python script
G1_perplexity.txt contains the perplexities for all the iterations for graph G1
source_pages_G1.txt contains the source pages for G1. There  are no source pages for G1. This file is empty
sinknodes_G1.txt contains the sink nodes for G1 graph
G2_perplixity.txt contains the perplexities for all the iterations for graph G1
source_pages_G2.txt contains the source pages for G2.
sinknodes_G2.txt contains the sink nodes for G2 graph
G1_pagerank_results.txt & G1_pagerank_results.txt contains the page rank of all the pages in G1 and G2 respectively


Task 3

Task3.pdf contains the Qualitative analysis of G1 and G2 page rank ordering
