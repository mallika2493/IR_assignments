history of landscape architecture
for the period before 1800 the history of landscape gardening  later called landscape architecture  is largely that of master planning and garden design for manor houses palaces and royal properties religious complexes and centers of government an example is the extensive work by andr  le n tre at vaux-le-vicomte for king louis xiv of france at the palace of versailles the first person to write of making a landscape was joseph addison in 1712 the term landscape architecture was invented by gilbert laing meason in 1828 and john claudius loudon  1783 1843  was instrumental in the adoption of the term landscape architecture by the modern profession he took up the term from meason and gave it publicity in his encyclopedias and in his 1840 book on the landscape gardening and landscape architecture of the late humphry repton
the practice of landscape architecture spread from the old to the new world the term  landscape architect  was used as a professional title by frederick law olmsted in the united states in 1863 and andrew jackson downing  1815 1852  another early american landscape designer was editor of the horticulturist magazine  1846 52  in 1841 his first book a treatise on the theory and practice of landscape gardening adapted to north america was published to a great success  it was the first book of its kind published in the united states during the latter 19th century the term landscape architect begun to be used by professional landscapes designers and was firmly established after frederick law olmsted jr and beatrix jones  later farrand  with others founded the american society of landscape architects  asla  in 1899 ifla was founded at cambridge england in 1948 with sir geoffrey jellicoe as its first president representing 15 countries from europe and north america later in 1978 ifla s headquarters were established in versailles
relation to urban planning
through the 19th century urban planning became a focal point and central issue in cities the combination of the tradition of landscape gardening and the emerging field of urban planning offered landscape architecture an opportunity to serve these needs in the second half of the century frederick law olmsted completed a series of parks which continue to have a huge influence on the practices of landscape architecture today among these were central park in new york city prospect park in brooklyn new york and boston s emerald necklace park system jens jensen designed sophisticated and naturalistic urban and regional parks for chicago illinois and private estates for the ford family including fair lane and gaukler point one of the original ten founding members of the american society of landscape architects  asla  and the only woman was beatrix farrand she was design consultant for over a dozen universities including  princeton in princeton new jersey  yale in new haven connecticut  and the arnold arboretum for harvard in boston massachusetts her numerous private estate projects include the landmark dumbarton oaks in the georgetown neighborhood of washington dc since that time other architects   most notably ruth havey and alden hopkins changed certain elements of the farrand design
since this period urban planning has developed into a separate independent profession that has incorporated important contributions from other fields such as civil engineering architecture and public administration urban planners are qualified to perform tasks independent of landscape architects and in general the curriculum of landscape architecture programs do not prepare students to become urban planners
landscape architecture continues to develop as a design discipline and to respond to the various movements in architecture and design throughout the 20th and 21st centuries thomas church was a mid-century landscape architect significant in the profession roberto burle marx in brazil combined the international style and native brazilian plants and culture for a new aesthetic innovation continues today solving challenging problems with contemporary design solutions for master planning landscapes and gardens
