related fields
environmental education has crossover with multiple other disciplines these fields of education complement environmental education yet have unique philosophies
while each of these educational fields has their own objectives there are points where they overlap with the intentions and philosophy of environmental education
history
the roots of environmental education can be traced back as early as the 18th century when jean-jacques rousseau stressed the importance of an education that focuses on the environment in emile  or on education several decades later louis agassiz a swiss-born naturalist echoed rousseau s philosophy as he encouraged students to  study nature not books  these two influential scholars helped lay the foundation for a concrete environmental education program known as nature study which took place in the late 19th century and early 20th century
the nature study movement used fables and moral lessons to help students develop an appreciation of nature and embrace the natural world anna botsford comstock the head of the department of nature study at cornell university was a prominent figure in the nature study movement and wrote the handbook for nature study in 1911 which used nature to educate children on cultural values comstock and the other leaders of the movement such as liberty hyde bailey helped nature study garner tremendous amounts of support from community leaders teachers and scientists and change the science curriculum for children across the united states
a new type of environmental education conservation education emerged as a result of the great depression and dust bowl during the 1920s and 1930s conservation education dealt with the natural world in a drastically different way from nature study because it focused on rigorous scientific training rather than natural history conservation education was a major scientific management and planning tool that helped solve social economic and environmental problems during this time period
the modern environmental education movement which gained significant momentum in the late 1960s and early 1970s stems from nature study and conservation education during this time period many events   such as civil rights the vietnam war and the cold war   placed americans at odds with one another and the us government however as more people began to fear the fallout from radiation the chemical pesticides mentioned in rachel carson s silent spring and the significant amounts of air pollution and waste the public s concern for their health and the health of their natural environment led to a unifying phenomenon known as environmentalism environmental education was born of the realization that solving complex local and global problems cannot be accomplished by politicians and experts alone but requires  the support and active participation of an informed public in their various roles as consumers voters employers and business and community leaders  
one of the first articles about environmental education as a new movement appeared in the phi delta kappan in 1969 authored by james a swan a definition of  environmental education  first appeared in the journal of environmental education in 1969 authored by william b stapp stapp later went on to become the first director of environmental education for unesco and then the global rivers international network
ultimately the first earth day on april 22 1970   a national teach-in about environmental problems   paved the way for the modern environmental education movement later that same year president nixon passed the national environmental education act which was intended to incorporate environmental education into k-12 schools then in 1971 the national association for environmental education  now known as the north american association for environmental education  was created to improve environmental literacy by providing resources to teachers and promoting environmental education programs
internationally environmental education gained recognition when the un conference on the human environment held in stockholm sweden in 1972 declared environmental education must be used as a tool to address global environmental problems the united nations education scientific and cultural organization  unesco  and united nations environment program  unep  created three major declarations that have guided the course of environmental education
stockholm declaration
june 5 16 1972 - the declaration of the united nations conference on the human environment the document was made up of 7 proclamations and 26 principles  to inspire and guide the peoples of the world in the preservation and enhancement of the human environment 
belgrade charter
october 13 22 1975 - the belgrade charter was the outcome of the international workshop on environmental education held in belgrade jugoslavia  now serbia  the belgrade charter was built upon the stockholm declaration and adds goals objectives and guiding principles of environmental education programs it defines an audience for environmental education which includes the general public
tbilisi declaration
october 14 26 1977 - the tbilisi declaration  noted the unanimous accord in the important role of environmental education in the preservation and improvement of the world s environment as well as in the sound and balanced development of the world s communities  the tbilisi declaration updated and clarified the stockholm declaration and the belgrade charter by including new goals objectives characteristics and guiding principles of environmental education
later that decade in 1977 the intergovernmental conference on environmental education in tbilisi georgia emphasized the role of environmental education in preserving and improving the global environment and sought to provide the framework and guidelines for environmental education the conference laid out the role objectives and characteristics of environmental education and provided several goals and principles for environmental education
about
environmental education has been considered an additional or elective subject in much of traditional k-12 curriculum at the elementary school level environmental education can take the form of science enrichment curriculum natural history field trips community service projects and participation in outdoor science schools ee policies assist schools and organizations in developing and improving environmental education programs that provide citizens with an in-depth understanding of the environment school related ee policies focus on three main components  curricula green facilities and training
schools can integrate environmental education into their curricula with sufficient funding from ee policies this approach   known as using the  environment as an integrating context  for learning   uses the local environment as a framework for teaching state and district education standards in addition to funding environmental curricula in the classroom environmental education policies allot the financial resources for hands-on outdoor learning these activities and lessons help address and mitigate  nature deficit disorder  as well as encourage healthier lifestyles
green schools or green facility promotion are another main component of environmental education policies greening school facilities cost on average a little less than 2 percent more than creating a traditional school but payback from these energy efficient buildings occur within only a few years environmental education policies help reduce the relatively small burden of the initial start-up costs for green schools green school policies also provide grants for modernization renovation or repair of older school facilities additionally healthy food options are also a central aspect of green schools these policies specifically focus on bringing freshly prepared food made from high-quality locally grown ingredients into schools
in secondary school environmental curriculum can be a focused subject within the sciences or is a part of student interest groups or clubs at the undergraduate and graduate level it can be considered its own field within education environmental studies environmental science and policy ecology or human cultural ecology programs
environmental education is not restricted to in-class lesson plans children can learn about the environment in many ways experiential lessons in the school yard field trips to national parks after-school green clubs and school-wide sustainability projects help make the environment an easily accessible topic furthermore celebration of earth day or participation in ee week  run through the national environmental education foundation  can help further environmental education effective programs promote a holistic approach and lead by example using sustainable practices in the school to encourage students and parents to bring environmental education into their home
the final aspect of environmental education policies involves training individuals to thrive in a sustainable society in addition to building a strong relationship with nature citizens must have the skills and knowledge to succeed in a 21st-century workforce thus environmental education policies fund both teacher training and worker training initiatives teachers train to effectively teach and incorporate environmental studies on the other hand the current workforce must be trained or re-trained so they can adapt to the new green economy environmental education policies that fund training programs are critical to educating citizens to prosper in a sustainable society
obstacles
a study of ontario teachers explored obstacles to environmental education through an internet-based survey questionnaire 300 k-12 teachers from ontario canada responded based on the results of the survey the most significant challenges identified by the sample of ontario teachers include over-crowded curriculum lack of resources low priority of environmental education in schools limited access to the outdoors student apathy to environmental issues and the controversial nature of sociopolitical action
an influential article by stevenson  2007  outlines conflicting goals of environmental education and traditional schooling according to stevenson  2007  the recent critical and action orientation of environmental education creates a challenging task for schools contemporary environmental education strives to transform values that underlie decision making from ones that aid environmental  and human  degradation to those that support a sustainable planet this contrasts with the traditional purpose of schools of conserving the existing social order by reproducing the norms and values that currently dominate environmental decision making confronting this contradiction is a major challenge to environmental education teachers
in the united states
following the 1970s non-governmental organizations that focused on environmental education continued to form and grow the number of teachers implementing environmental education in their classrooms increased and the movement gained stronger political backing a critical move forward came when the united states congress passed the national environmental education act of 1990 which placed the office of environmental education in the us environmental protection agency and allowed the epa to create environmental education initiatives at the federal level
in the united states some of the antecedents of environmental education were nature studies conservation education and school camping nature studies integrated academic approach with outdoor exploration  roth 1978  conservation education brought awareness to the misuse of natural resources george perkins marsh discoursed on humanity s integral part of the natural world the governmental agencies like the us forest service and the epa were also pushing a conservation agenda conservation ideals still guide environmental education today school camping was exposure to the environment and use of resources outside of the classroom for educational purposes the legacies of these antecedents are still present in the evolving arena of environmental education
trends
one of the current trends within environmental education seeks to move from an approach of ideology and activism to one that allows students to make informed decisions and take action based on experience as well as data within this process environmental curricula have progressively been integrated into governmental education standards some environmental educators find this movement distressing and a move away from the original political and activist approach to environmental education while others find this approach more valid and accessible
movement
a movement that has progressed since the relatively recent founding  1960s  of environmental education in industrial societies has transported the participant from nature appreciation and awareness to education for an ecologically sustainable future this trend may be viewed as a microcosm of how many environmental education programs seek to first engage participants through developing a sense of nature appreciation which then translates into actions that affect conservation and sustainability
programs range from new york to california including life lab at university of california santa cruz as well as cornell university in ithaca
