land use - wikipedia
land use involves the management and modification of natural environment or wilderness into built environment such as settlements and semi-natural habitats such as arable fields pastures and managed woods it also has been defined as  the total of arrangements activities and inputs that people undertake in a certain land cover type 


regulation
land use practices vary considerably across the world the united nations  food and agriculture organization water development division explains that  land use concerns the products and or benefits obtained from use of the land as well as the land management actions  activities  carried out by humans to produce those products and benefits  as of the early 1990s about 13  of the earth was considered arable land with 26  in pasture 32  forests and woodland and 1.5  urban areas
as albert guttenberg  1959  wrote many years ago   land use  is a key term in the language of city planning  commonly political jurisdictions will undertake land-use planning and regulate the use of land in an attempt to avoid land-use conflicts land use plans are implemented through land division and use ordinances and regulations such as zoning regulations management consulting firms and non-governmental organizations will frequently seek to influence these regulations before they are codified
united states
in colonial america few regulations existed to control the use of land due to the seemingly endless amounts of it as society shifted from rural to urban public land regulation became important especially to city governments trying to control industry commerce and housing within their boundaries the first zoning ordinance was passed in new york city in 1916 and by the 1930s most states had adopted zoning laws in the 1970s concerns about the environment and historic preservation led to further regulation
today federal state and local governments regulate growth and development through statutory law the majority of controls on land however stem from the actions of private developers and individuals three typical situations bringing such private entities into the court system are  suits brought by one neighbor against another  suits brought by a public official against a neighboring landowner on behalf of the public  and suits involving individuals who share ownership of a particular parcel of land in these situations judicial decisions and enforcement of private land-use arrangements can reinforce public regulation and achieve forms and levels of control that regulatory zoning cannot
two major federal laws have been passed in the last half century that limit the use of land significantly these are the national historic preservation act of 1966  today embodied in 16 usc 461 et seq  and the national environmental policy act of 1969  42 usc 4321 et seq 
environment
land use and land management practices have a major impact on natural resources including water soil nutrients plants and animals land use information can be used to develop solutions for natural resource management issues such as salinity and water quality for instance water bodies in a region that has been deforested or having erosion will have different water quality than those in areas that are forested forest gardening a plant-based food production system is believed to be the oldest form of land use in the world
the major effect of land use on land cover since 1750 has been deforestation of temperate regions more recent significant effects of land use include urban sprawl soil erosion soil degradation salinization and desertification land-use change together with use of fossil fuels are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide a dominant greenhouse gas
according to a report by the united nations  food and agriculture organisation land degradation has been exacerbated where there has been an absence of any land use planning or of its orderly execution or the existence of financial or legal incentives that have led to the wrong land use decisions or one-sided central planning leading to over-utilization of the land resources - for instance for immediate production at all costs as a consequence the result has often been misery for large segments of the local population and destruction of valuable ecosystems such narrow approaches should be replaced by a technique for the planning and management of land resources that is integrated and holistic and where land users are central this will ensure the long-term quality of the land for human use the prevention or resolution of social conflicts related to land use and the conservation of ecosystems of high biodiversity value
urban growth boundaries
the urban growth boundary is one form of land-use regulation for example portland oregon is required to have an urban growth boundary which contains at least 20,000 acres  81 km2  of vacant land additionally oregon restricts the development of farmland the regulations are controversial but an economic analysis concluded that farmland appreciated similarly to the other land
