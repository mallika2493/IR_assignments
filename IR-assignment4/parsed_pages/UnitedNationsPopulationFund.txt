relations with the us government
unfpa has been falsely accused by groups opposed to abortion of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations controversies regarding these claims have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and three presidential administrations that of ronald reagan george h w bush and george w bush withholding funding from the unfpa
unfpa provided aid to peru s reproductive health program in the mid-to-late  90s when it was discovered a peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations unfpa called for reforms and protocols to protect the rights of women seeking assistance unfpa was not involved in the scandal but continued work with the country after the abuses had become public to help end the abuses and reform laws and practices 
from 2002 through 2008 the bush administration denied funding to unfpa that had already been allocated by the us congress partly on the refuted claims that the unfpa supported chinese government programs which include forced abortions and coercive sterilizations in a letter from the undersecretary of state for political affairs nicholas burns to congress the administration said it had determined that unfpa s support for china s population program  facilitates  its  government s coercive abortion program  thus violating the kemp-kasten amendment which bans the use of united states aid to finance organizations that support or take part in managing a program of coercive abortion of sterilization
unfpa says it  does not provide support for abortion services  its charter includes a strong statement condemning coercion
unfpa s connection to china s administration of forced abortions was refuted by investigations carried out by various us uk and un teams sent to examine unfpa activities in china specifically a three-person us state department fact-finding team was sent on a two-week tour throughout china it wrote in a report to the state department that it found  no evidence that unfpa has supported or participated in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in china  as has been charged by critics
however according to then-secretary of state colin powell the unfpa contributed vehicles and computers to the chinese to carry out their population planning policies however both the washington post and the washington times reported that powell simply fell in line signing a brief written by someone else 
rep christopher h smith  r-nj  criticized the state department investigation saying the investigators were shown  potemkin villages  where residents had been intimidated into lying about the family-planning program dr nafis sadik former director of unfpa said her agency had been pivotal in reversing china s coercive population planning methods but a 2005 report by amnesty international and a separate report by the united states state department found that coercive techniques were still regularly employed by the chinese casting doubt upon sadik s statements
but amnesty international found no evidence that unfpa had supported the coercion a 2001 study conducted by the pro-life population research institute  pri  falsely claimed that the unfpa shared an office with the chinese family planning officials who were carrying out forced abortions  we located the family planning offices and in that family planning office we located the unfpa office and we confirmed from family planning officials there that there is no distinction between what the unfpa does and what the chinese family planning office does  said scott weinberg a spokesman for pri however united nations members disagreed and approved unfpa s new country program me in january 2006 the more than 130 members of the  group of 77  developing countries in the united nations expressed support for the unfpa programmes in addition speaking for european democracies -- norway denmark sweden finland the netherlands france belgium switzerland and germany -- the united kingdom stated  unfpa s activities in china as in the rest of the world are in strict conformity with the unanimously adopted programme of action of the icpd and play a key role in supporting our common endeavor the promotion and protection of all human rights and fundamental freedoms  
president bush denied funding to the unfpa over the course of the bush administration a total of  244 million in congressionally approved funding was blocked by the executive branch
in response the eu decided to fill the gap left behind by the us under the sandbaek report according to its annual report for 2008 the unfpa received its funding mainly from european governments  of the total income of m845.3 m  118 was donated by the netherlands  67 m by sweden  62 m by norway  54 m by denmark  53 m by the uk  52 m by spain  19 m by luxembourg the european commission donated further  36 m the most important non-european donor state was japan   36 m  the number of donors exceeded 180 in one year
in america nonprofit organizations like friends of unfpa  formerly americans for unfpa  worked to compensate for the loss of united states federal funding by raising private donations
in january 2009 president barack obama restored us funding to unfpa saying in a public statement that he would  look forward to working with congress to restore us financial support for the un population fund by resuming funding to unfpa the us will be joining 180 other donor nations working collaboratively to reduce poverty improve the health of women and children prevent hiv aids and provide family planning assistance to women in 154 countries
