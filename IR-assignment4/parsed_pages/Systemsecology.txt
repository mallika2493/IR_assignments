systems ecology - wikipedia
systems ecology is an interdisciplinary field of ecology a subset of earth system science that takes a holistic approach to the study of ecological systems especially ecosystems systems ecology can be seen as an application of general systems theory to ecology central to the systems ecology approach is the idea that an ecosystem is a complex system exhibiting emergent properties systems ecology focuses on interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems and is especially concerned with the way the functioning of ecosystems can be influenced by human interventions it uses and extends concepts from thermodynamics and develops other macroscopic descriptions of complex systems


overview
systems ecology seeks a holistic view of the interactions and transactions within and between biological and ecological systems systems ecologists realise that the function of any ecosystem can be influenced by human economics in fundamental ways they have therefore taken an additional transdisciplinary step by including economics in the consideration of ecological-economic systems in the words of rl kitching 
as a mode of scientific enquiry a central feature of systems ecology is the general application of the principles of energetics to all systems at any scale perhaps the most notable proponent of this view was howard t odum - sometimes considered the father of ecosystems ecology in this approach the principles of energetics constitute ecosystem principles reasoning by formal analogy from one system to another enables the systems ecologist to see principles functioning in an analogous manner across system-scale boundaries ht odum commonly used the energy systems language as a tool for making systems diagrams and flow charts
the fourth of these principles the principle of maximum power efficiency takes central place in the analysis and synthesis of ecological systems the fourth principle suggests that the most evolutionarily advantageous system function occurs when the environmental load matches the internal resistance of the system the further the environmental load is from matching the internal resistance the further the system is away from its sustainable steady state therefore the systems ecologist engages in a task of resistance and impedance matching in ecological engineering just as the electronic engineer would do

deep ecology
deep ecology is an ideology whose metaphysical underpinnings are deeply concerned with the science of ecology the term was coined by arne naess a norwegian philosopher gandhian scholar and environmental activist he argues that the prevailing approach to environmental management is anthropocentric and that the natural environment is not only  more complex than we imagine it is more complex than we can imagine  naess formulated deep ecology in 1973 at an environmental conference in budapest
joanna macy john seed and others developed naess  thesis into a branch they called experiential deep ecology their efforts were motivated by a need they perceived for the development of an  ecological self  which views the human ego as an integrated part of a living system that encompasses the individual they sought to transcend altruism with a deeper self-interest based on biospherical equality beyond human chauvinism
earth systems engineering and management
earth systems engineering and management  esem  is a discipline used to analyze design engineer and manage complex environmental systems it entails a wide range of subject areas including anthropology engineering environmental science ethics and philosophy at its core esem looks to  rationally design and manage coupled human-natural systems in a highly integrated and ethical fashion 
ecological economics
ecological economics is a transdisciplinary field of academic research that addresses the dynamic and spatial interdependence between human economies and natural ecosystems ecological economics brings together and connects different disciplines within the natural and social sciences but especially between these broad areas as the name suggests the field is made up of researchers with a background in economics and ecology an important motivation for the emergence of ecological economics has been criticism on the assumptions and approaches of traditional  mainstream  environmental and resource economics
ecological energetics
ecological energetics is the quantitative study of the flow of energy through ecological systems it aims to uncover the principles which describe the propensity of such energy flows through the trophic or  energy availing  levels of ecological networks in systems ecology the principles of ecosystem energy flows or  ecosystem laws   ie principles of ecological energetics  are considered formally analogous to the principles of energetics
ecological humanities
ecological humanities aims to bridge the divides between the sciences and the humanities and between western eastern and indigenous ways of knowing nature like ecocentric political theory the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to ecological laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system
ecosystem ecology
ecosystem ecology is the integrated study of biotic and abiotic components of ecosystems and their interactions within an ecosystem framework this science examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as chemicals bedrock soil plants and animals ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structure and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact
the relationship between systems ecology and ecosystem ecology is complex much of systems ecology can be considered a subset of ecosystem ecology ecosystem ecology also utilizes methods that have little to do with the holistic approach of systems ecology however systems ecology more actively considers external influences such as economics that usually fall outside the bounds of ecosystem ecology whereas ecosystem ecology can be defined as the scientific study of ecosystems systems ecology is more of a particular approach to the study of ecological systems and phenomena that interact with these systems
industrial ecology
industrial ecology is the study of industrial processes as linear  open loop  systems in which resource and capital investments move through the system to become waste to a closed loop system where wastes become inputs for new processes
