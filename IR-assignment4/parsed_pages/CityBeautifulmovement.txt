city beautiful movement - wikipedia
the city beautiful movement was a reform philosophy of north american architecture and urban planning that flourished during the 1890s and 1900s with the intent of introducing beautification and monumental grandeur in cities the movement which was originally associated mainly with chicago cleveland detroit and washington dc promoted beauty not only for its own sake but also to create moral and civic virtue among urban populations advocates of the philosophy believed that such beautification could promote a harmonious social order that would increase the quality of life while critics would complain that the movement was overly concerned with aesthetics at the expense of social reform  jane jacobs referred to the movement as an  architectural design cult 


history
origins and effect
the movement began in the united states in response to crowding in tenement districts a consequence of high birth rates increased immigration and internal migration of rural populations into cities the movement flourished for several decades and in addition to the construction of monuments it also achieved great influence in urban planning that endured throughout the 20th century in particular in regard to the later creation of housing projects in the united states the  garden city  movement in britain influenced the contemporary planning of some newer suburbs of london and there was cross-influence between the two aesthetics one based in formal garden plans and urbanization schemes and the other with its  semi-detached villas  evoking a more rural atmosphere
architectural idioms
the particular architectural style of the movement borrowed mainly from the contemporary beaux-arts and neoclassical architectures which emphasized the necessity of order dignity and harmony
world s columbian exposition
the first large-scale elaboration of the city beautiful occurred during the world s columbian exposition of 1893 in chicago the planning of the exposition was directed by architect daniel burnham who hired architects from the eastern united states as well as the sculptor augustus saint-gaudens to build large-scale beaux-arts monuments that were vaguely classical with uniform cornice height the exposition displayed a model city of grand scale known as the  white city  with modern transport systems and no poverty visible the exposition is credited with resulting in the large-scale adoption of monumentalism for american architecture for the next 15 years richmond virginia s monument avenue is one expression of this initial phase
louisiana purchase exposition
the popularization begun by the world columbian exposition was increased by the louisiana purchase exposition in st louis in 1904 the commissioner of architects selected franco-american architect emmanuel louis masqueray to be chief of design of the fair in this position which masqueray held for three years he designed the following fair buildings in the prevailing beaux arts mode  the palace of agriculture  the cascades and colonnades  the palace of forestry fish and game  the palace of horticulture  and the palace of transportation all these were widely emulated in civic projects across the united states masqueray resigned soon after the fair opened in 1904 having been invited by archbishop john ireland of st paul to minnesota to design a new cathedral for the city in the fair s beaux arts style other celebrated architects of the fair s buildings notably cass gilbert who designed the saint louis art museum originally the fair s palace of the fine arts similarly employed city beautiful ideas from the exposition throughout their careers
mcmillan plan
an early use of the city beautiful ideal with the intent of creating social order through beautification was the mcmillan plan  1902  named for michigan senator james mcmillan the plan emerged from the senate park commission s redesigning of the monumental core of washington dc to commemorate the city s centennial and to fulfill unrealized aspects of the city plan of pierre charles l enfant a century earlier
the washington planners who included burnham saint-gaudens charles mckim of mckim mead and white and frederick law olmsted jr visited many of the great cities of europe they hoped to make washington monumental and green like the european capitals of the era  they believed that state-organized beautification could lend legitimacy to government during a time of social disturbance in the united states the essence of the plan surrounded the united states capitol with monumental government buildings to replace  notorious slum communities  at the heart of the design was the creation of the national mall and eventually included burnham s union station the implementation of the plan was interrupted by world war i but resumed after the war culminating in the construction of the lincoln memorial in 1922
influence in other cities
the success of the city beautiful philosophy in washington dc is credited with influencing subsequent plans for beautification of many other cities including chicago baltimore cleveland columbus des moines denver madison  with the axis from the capitol building through state street and to the university of wisconsin campus  montreal new york city  notably the manhattan municipal building  philadelphia  the benjamin franklin parkway museum district between philadelphia city hall and the philadelphia museum of art  pittsburgh  the schenley farms district in the oakland neighborhood of parks museums and universities  san antonio texas  san antonio river development  san francisco  manifested by its civic center  and the washington state capitol campus in olympia and the university of washington s rainier vista in seattle in wilmington delaware it inspired the creation of rodney square and the surrounding civic buildings in new haven john russell pope developed a plan for yale university that eliminated substandard housing and relocated the urban poor to the peripheries kansas city missouri and dallas texas undertook the installation of parkways and parks under the influence of the movement and coral gables florida would be an example of a city consistent with the city beautiful philosophy
daniel burnham s 1909 plan of chicago is considered one of principle documents of the city beautiful movement the plan featured a dynamic new civic center axial streets and a lush strip of parkland for recreation alongside the city s lakefront of these only the lakefront park was implemented to any significant degree
in 1913 the city of chicago appointed a commission with a mandate to  make chicago beautiful  as part of the plan the pennsylvania union railroad depot was to be moved to the west side of the city and replaced with a new modern depot the west side property owner s association was among those who objected as reported by the chicago tribune the association s attorney sidney adler of loeb   adler said  as i saw the beautiful picture of the city beautiful we will have fountains in west madison street with poets and poetesses walking along clinton and the simple minded residents of the west side after work is done will take their gondolas and row on the limpid bosom of the chicago river idlely strumming guitars

in denver colorado mayor robert w speer endorsed city beautiful planning with a plan for a civic center disposed along a grand esplanade that led to the colorado state capitol the plan was partly realized on a reduced scale with the greek amphitheater voorhies memorial and the colonnade of civic benefactors completed in 1919 the andrew carnegie foundation funded the denver public library  1910  which was designed as a three-story greek revival temple with a colossal ionic colonnade across its front  inside it featured open shelves an art gallery and a children s room monuments and vistas were an essential feature of city beautiful urban planning  in denver paris-trained american sculptor frederick macmonnies was commissioned to design a monument marking the end of the smoky hill trail the bronze indian guide he envisaged was vetoed by the committee and replaced with an equestrian kit carson
harrisburg s movement of beautification and improvement was one of the earliest and most successful urban reform movements in the country it began when local minded residents became convinced that their city was unattractive unhealthy and filthy and lacked the appearance and facilities appropriate to its status as pennsylvania s state capital the causes of the city s defects were well known  industrialization in the previous half century had left the city poorly planned with unpaved streets and undeveloped water management systems residents of harrisburg suffered disease and illnesses caused by the lack of good filtration systems that could filter the sewage dumped by populations further up the susquehanna river a disastrous fire that consumed the state capitol in 1897 had spawned new conversation about the suitability of harrisburg as a state capital
the improvement campaign was sparked by a riveting speech of conservationist mira lloyd dock to the harrisburg board of trade on december 20 1900 dock wanted to publicly challenge the horrific conditions in harrisburg and set out to gain public sentiment in support of changing them dock s speech was titled  the city beautiful  or  improvement work at home and abroad  and this was the starting point for harrisburg s city improvements dock s contemporary and closest ally in her drive for urban beautification was j horace mcfarland who was the president of the american civic association with mcfarland and dock working together they were able to push the process of municipal improvement in harrisburg by convincing prominent community leaders to donate money and by gathering the support of the majority of citizens in april 1901 the harrisburg telegraph a city newspaper published a front-page article on the city s problems which stressed dock s message of beautification and recreation paved streets clean water a city hall land for parks and a covered sewer interceptor along the river the following february 1901 the population voted in favor of a bond issue that funded  1.1 million in new constructions and city planning these improvements combined with a new state capitol building in 1906 quickly transformed harrisburg into a proud modern city by 1915
in memphis the city beautiful commission was officially established by a city ordinance on july 1 1930 making it the first and oldest beautification commission in the nation it was the brainchild of the mayor mr e h crump the first commission was appointed and had operating expenses of  1,500 a small office was set up in the nineteenth century club mrs e g willingham was chosen as chairman and mrs william b fowler served as vice chairman in 1935 the riverside drive project was dedicated costing nearly  1,000,000  largely wpa funds  the city beautiful commission landscaped the bluffs with crape myrtle redbuds magnolias dogwoods and paul scarlet roses white roses were planted at each guardrail post in 1936 mrs william b fowler became chairman of the city beautiful commission and served for many years city beautiful grew under her leadership and soon had to relocate to larger headquarters through the efforts of city beautiful memphis gained the title of cleanest city in tennessee in 1940 1941 1942 1943 1944 1945 and 1946 memphis also received the ernest t trigg  nation s cleanest city  award in 1948 1949 1950 and 1951 during this time volunteers were organized into wards and block clubs with ward chairmen and block captains the city beautiful staff grew to include 30 inspectors by 1954 who worked through these organizations to identify and improve eyesores memphis participated with the national clean-up paint-up fix-up beautification bureau headquartered in washington dc in 1978 the commission was reorganized eliminating the field inspectors in february 1989 the commission moved to its present location at the massey house in victorian village memphis

in australia
both european and north american cities provided models for the australian city beautiful movement a combination of elements about 1900 also influenced the movement 
however city beautiful was not solely concerned with aesthetics the term  beautility  derived from the american city beautiful philosophy which meant that the beautification of a city must also be functional beautility including the proven economic value of improvements influenced australian town planning
there were no formal city beautiful organisations that led this movement in australia  rather it was influenced by communications among professionals and bureaucrats in particular architect-planners and local government reformers in the early federation era some influential australians were determined that their cities be progressive and competitive adelaide was used as an australian example of the  benefits of comprehensive civic design  with its ring of parklands beautification of the city of hobart for example was considered a way to increase the city s popularity as a tourist destination
canberra
walter burley griffin incorporated city beautiful principles for his design for canberra griffin was influenced by washington  with grand axes and vistas and a strong central focal point  with specialised centres and being a landscape architect used the landscape to complement this layout john sulman however was australia s  leading proponent  of the city beautiful movement and in 1921 wrote the book an introduction to australian city planning both the city beautiful and the garden city philosophies were represented by sulman s  geometric or contour controlled  designs of the circulatory road systems in canberra the widths of pavements were also reduced and vegetated areas were increased such as planted road verges
melbourne
melbourne s grid plan was considered dull and monotonous by some people and so the architect william campbell designed a blueprint for the city the main principle behind this were diagonal streets providing sites for new and comprehensive architecture and for special buildings the designs of paris and washington were major inspirations for this plan
city beautiful in australia today
world war i prolonged the city beautiful movement in australia as more memorials were erected than in any other country although city beautiful or artistic planning became a part of comprehensive town planning the great depression of the 1930s largely ended this fashion now however in australia many streets are tree-lined and streetscapes and skylines are regulated this was largely a result of the city beautiful philosophy
