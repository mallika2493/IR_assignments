green belt - wikipedia
a green belt or greenbelt is a policy and land use designation used in land use planning to retain areas of largely undeveloped wild or agricultural land surrounding or neighbouring urban areas similar concepts are greenways or green wedges which have a linear character and may run through an urban area instead of around it in essence a green belt is an invisible line designating a border around a certain area preventing development of the area and allowing wildlife to return and be established


purposes
in those countries which have them the stated objectives of green belt policy are to 
the green belt has many benefits for people 
the effectiveness of green belts differs depending on location and country they can often be eroded by urban rural fringe uses and sometimes development  jumps  over the green belt area resulting in the creation of  satellite towns  which although separated from the city by green belt function more like suburbs than independent communities
history
the old testament outlines a proposal for a green belt around the levite towns in the land of israel moses maimonides expounded that the greenbelt plan from the old testament referred to all towns in ancient israel in the 7th century muhammad established a green belt around medina he did this by prohibiting any further removal of trees in a 12-mile long strip around the city in 1580 elizabeth i of england banned new building in a 3-mile wide belt around the city of london in an attempt to stop the spread of plague however this was not widely enforced and it was possible to buy dispensations which reduced the effectiveness of the proclamation
in modern times the term emerged from continental europe where broad boulevards were increasingly used to separate new development from the centre of historic towns  most notably the ringstra e in vienna green belt policy was then pioneered in the united kingdom various proposals were put forward from 1890 onwards but the first to garner widespread support was put forward by the london society in its  development plan of greater london  1919 alongside the cpre they lobbied for a continuous belt  of up to two miles wide  to prevent urban sprawl beyond which new development could occur
there are fourteen green belt areas in the uk covering 16,716 km  or 13  of england and 164 km  of scotland  for a detailed discussion of these see green belt  uk  other notable examples are the ottawa greenbelt and golden horseshoe greenbelt in ontario canada ottawa s 20,350 hectare greenbelt is managed by the national capital commission  ncc  the more general term in the us is green space or greenspace which may be a very small area such as a park
the dynamic adelaide park lands measuring approximately 7.6 km  completely surround the city centre of adelaide on the fringe of the eastern suburbs an expansive natural greenbelt in the adelaide hills acts as a growth boundary for adelaide cooling the region in the hottest months
the concept of  green belt  has evolved in recent years to encompass not only  greenspace  but also  greenstructure  taking into account all urban greenspaces an important aspect of sustainable development in the 21st century the european commission s cost action c11  cost   european cooperation in science and technology  is undertaking  case studies in greenstructure planning  involving 15 european countries
an act of the swedish parliament from 1994 has declared a series of parks in stockholm and the adjacent municipality of solna to its north a  national city park  called royal national city park
criticism
house prices
the difference contrarian interpretation of the green belt s effects motivation  for example suggested by economist tim harford  is that a green belt is created by residents to preserve the bourgeois status quo of those already living within the zone and especially the advantage of landlords who profit from a scarcity of housing  see above  preserving the character of rural communities   the stated motivation and benefits of the green belt might be well-intentioned  public health environment  but these benefits do not accrue as intentioned or claimed  for example critics such as mark pennington claim that only a small fraction of the population ever sets foot on the green belt for leisure purposes and they claim that a green belt is not strongly causally linked to clean air and water  rather the ultimate result of the decision to green-belt a city is to prevent housing demand within the zone to be met with supply thus exacerbating high housing prices and stifling competitive forces in general
increasing urban sprawl
another area of criticism comes from the fact that since a greenbelt does not extend indefinitely outside a city it spurs the growth of areas much further away from the city core than if it had not existed thereby actually increasing urban sprawl examples commonly cited are the ottawa suburbs of kanata and orleans both of which are outside the city s greenbelt and are currently undergoing explosive growth  see greenbelt  ottawa   this leads to other problems as residents of these areas have a longer commute to work places in the city and worse access to public transport it also means people have to commute through the green belt an area not designed to cope with high levels of transportation not only is the merit of a green belt subverted but the green belt may heighten the problem and make the city unsustainable
there are many examples whereby the actual effect of green belts is to act as a land reserve for future freeways and other highways examples include sections of the 407 highway north of toronto and the hunt club rd richmond rd south of ottawa whether they are originally planned as such or the result of a newer administration taking advantage of land that was left available by its predecessors is debatable
united kingdom
greenbelt barriers in the uk to urban expansion have been criticised as one of several protectionist political-economic barriers to housebuilding with negative effects on the supply cost prices and quality of new homes critics argue that the greenbelts actually defeat their own stated objective of saving the countryside and open spaces by preventing existing towns and cities from extending normally and organically they result in more land-extensive housing developments further out   ie the establishment beyond the greenbelts of new communities with lower building densities their own built infrastructure and other facilities and greater dependence on cars and commuting etc meanwhile valuable urban green space and brownfield sites best suited to industry and commerce are lost in existing conurbations as more and more new housing is crammed into them
