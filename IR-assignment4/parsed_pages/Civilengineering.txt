civil engineering - wikipedia
civil engineering is a professional engineering discipline that deals with the design construction and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment including works like roads bridges canals dams and buildings civil engineering is the second-oldest engineering discipline after military engineering and it is defined to distinguish non-military engineering from military engineering it is traditionally broken into several sub-disciplines including architectural engineering environmental engineering geotechnical engineering control engineering structural engineering earthquake engineering transportation engineering forensic engineering municipal or urban engineering water resources engineering materials engineering wastewater engineering offshore engineering facade engineering coastal engineering construction surveying and construction engineering civil engineering takes place in the public sector from municipal through to national governments and in the private sector from individual homeowners through to international companies


history of the civil engineering profession
engineering has been an aspect of life since the beginnings of human existence the earliest practice of civil engineering may have commenced between 4000 and 2000 bc in ancient egypt the indus valley civilization and mesopotamia  ancient iraq  when humans started to abandon a nomadic existence creating a need for the construction of shelter during this time transportation became increasingly important leading to the development of the wheel and sailing
until modern times there was no clear distinction between civil engineering and architecture and the term engineer and architect were mainly geographical variations referring to the same occupation and often used interchangeably the construction of pyramids in egypt  circa 2700 2500 bc  were some of the first instances of large structure constructions other ancient historic civil engineering constructions include the qanat water management system  the oldest is older than 3000 years and longer than 71 km  the parthenon by iktinos in ancient greece  447 438 bc  the appian way by roman engineers  c 312 bc  the great wall of china by general meng t ien under orders from ch in emperor shih huang ti  c 220 bc  and the stupas constructed in ancient sri lanka like the jetavanaramaya and the extensive irrigation works in anuradhapura the romans developed civil structures throughout their empire including especially aqueducts insulae harbors bridges dams and roads
in the 18th century the term civil engineering was coined to incorporate all things civilian as opposed to military engineering the first self-proclaimed civil engineer was john smeaton who constructed the eddystone lighthouse in 1771 smeaton and some of his colleagues formed the smeatonian society of civil engineers a group of leaders of the profession who met informally over dinner though there was evidence of some technical meetings it was little more than a social society
in 1818 the institution of civil engineers was founded in london and in 1820 the eminent engineer thomas telford became its first president the institution received a royal charter in 1828 formally recognising civil engineering as a profession its charter defined civil engineering as 
history of civil engineering education
the first private college to teach civil engineering in the united states was norwich university founded in 1819 by captain alden partridge the first degree in civil engineering in the united states was awarded by rensselaer polytechnic institute in 1835 the first such degree to be awarded to a woman was granted by cornell university to nora stanton blatch in 1905
in the uk during the early 19th century the division between civil engineering and military engineering  served by the royal military academy woolwich  coupled with the demands of the industrial revolution spawned new engineering education initiatives  the royal polytechnic institution was founded in 1838 the private college for civil engineers in putney was established in 1839 and the uk s first chair of engineering was established at the university of glasgow in 1840
history of civil engineering
civil engineering is the application of physical and scientific principles for solving the problems of society and its history is intricately linked to advances in understanding of physics and mathematics throughout history because civil engineering is a wide ranging profession including several separate specialized sub-disciplines its history is linked to knowledge of structures materials science geography geology soils hydrology environment mechanics and other fields
throughout ancient and medieval history most architectural design and construction was carried out by artisans such as stonemasons and carpenters rising to the role of master builder knowledge was retained in guilds and seldom supplanted by advances structures roads and infrastructure that existed were repetitive and increases in scale were incremental
one of the earliest examples of a scientific approach to physical and mathematical problems applicable to civil engineering is the work of archimedes in the 3rd century bc including archimedes principle which underpins our understanding of buoyancy and practical solutions such as archimedes  screw brahmagupta an indian mathematician used arithmetic in the 7th century ad based on hindu-arabic numerals for excavation  volume  computations

education and licensure
civil engineers typically possess an academic degree in civil engineering the length of study is three to five years and the completed degree is designated as a bachelor of engineering or a bachelor of science the curriculum generally includes classes in physics mathematics project management design and specific topics in civil engineering after taking basic courses in most sub-disciplines of civil engineering they move onto specialize in one or more sub-disciplines at advanced levels while an undergraduate degree  beng bsc  normally provides successful students with industry-accredited qualification some academic institutions offer post-graduate degrees  meng msc  which allow students to further specialize in their particular area of interest
in most countries a bachelor s degree in engineering represents the first step towards professional certification and a professional body certifies the degree program after completing a certified degree program the engineer must satisfy a range of requirements  including work experience and exam requirements  before being certified once certified the engineer is designated as a professional engineer  in the united states canada and south africa  a chartered engineer  in most commonwealth countries  a chartered professional engineer  in australia and new zealand  or a european engineer  in most countries of the european union  there are international agreements between relevant professional bodies to allow engineers to practice across national borders
the benefits of certification vary depending upon location for example in the united states and canada  only a licensed professional engineer may prepare sign and seal and submit engineering plans and drawings to a public authority for approval or seal engineering work for public and private clients  this requirement is enforced under provincial law such as the engineers act in quebec
no such legislation has been enacted in other countries including the united kingdom in australia state licensing of engineers is limited to the state of queensland almost all certifying bodies maintain a code of ethics which all members must abide by
engineers must obey contract law in their contractual relationships with other parties in cases where an engineer s work fails he may be subject to the law of tort of negligence and in extreme cases criminal charges an engineer s work must also comply with numerous other rules and regulations such as building codes and environmental law
sub-disciplines
in general civil engineering is concerned with the overall interface of human created fixed projects with the greater world general civil engineers work closely with surveyors and specialized civil engineers to design grading drainage pavement water supply sewer servicedams electric and communications supply general civil engineering is also referred to as site engineering a branch of civil engineering that primarily focuses on converting a tract of land from one usage to another site engineers spend time visiting project sites meeting with stakeholders and preparing construction plans civil engineers apply the principles of geotechnical engineering structural engineering environmental engineering transportation engineering and construction engineering to residential commercial industrial and public works projects of all sizes and levels of construction
materials science and engineering
materials science is closely related to civil engineering it studies fundamental characteristics of materials and deals with ceramics such as concrete and mix asphalt concrete strong metals such as aluminum and steel and polymers including polymethylmethacrylate  pmma  and carbon fibers
materials engineering involves protection and prevention  paints and finishes  alloying combines two types of metals to produce another metal with desired properties it incorporates elements of applied physics and chemistry with recent media attention on nanoscience and nanotechnology materials engineering has been at the forefront of academic research it is also an important part of forensic engineering and failure analysis
coastal engineering
coastal engineering is concerned with managing coastal areas in some jurisdictions the terms sea defense and coastal protection mean defense against flooding and erosion respectively the term coastal defense is the more traditional term but coastal management has become more popular as the field has expanded to techniques that allow erosion to claim land
construction engineering
construction engineering involves planning and execution transportation of materials site development based on hydraulic environmental structural and geotechnical engineering as construction firms tend to have higher business risk than other types of civil engineering firms do construction engineers often engage in more business-like transactions for example drafting and reviewing contracts evaluating logistical operations and monitoring prices of supplies
earthquake engineering
earthquake engineering involves designing structures to withstand hazardous earthquake exposures earthquake engineering is a sub-discipline of structural engineering the main objectives of earthquake engineering are to understand interaction of structures on the shaky ground  foresee the consequences of possible earthquakes  and design construct and maintain structures to perform at earthquake in compliance with building codes
environmental engineering
environmental engineering is the contemporary term for sanitary engineering though sanitary engineering traditionally had not included much of the hazardous waste management and environmental remediation work covered by environmental engineering public health engineering and environmental health engineering are other terms being used
environmental engineering deals with treatment of chemical biological or thermal wastes purification of water and air and remediation of contaminated sites after waste disposal or accidental contamination among the topics covered by environmental engineering are pollutant transport water purification waste water treatment air pollution solid waste treatment and hazardous waste management environmental engineers administer pollution reduction green engineering and industrial ecology environmental engineers also compile information on environmental consequences of proposed actions
geotechnical engineering
geotechnical engineering studies rock and soil supporting civil engineering systems knowledge from the field of soil science materials science mechanics and hydraulics is applied to safely and economically design foundations retaining walls and other structures environmental efforts to protect groundwater and safely maintain landfills have spawned a new area of research called geoenvironmental engineering
identification of soil properties presents challenges to geotechnical engineers boundary conditions are often well defined in other branches of civil engineering but unlike steel or concrete the material properties and behavior of soil are difficult to predict due to its variability and limitation on investigation furthermore soil exhibits nonlinear  stress-dependent  strength stiffness and dilatancy  volume change associated with application of shear stress  making studying soil mechanics all the more difficult
water resources engineering
water resources engineering is concerned with the collection and management of water  as a natural resource  as a discipline it therefore combines elements of hydrology environmental science meteorology conservation and resource management this area of civil engineering relates to the prediction and management of both the quality and the quantity of water in both underground  aquifers  and above ground  lakes rivers and streams  resources water resource engineers analyze and model very small to very large areas of the earth to predict the amount and content of water as it flows into through or out of a facility although the actual design of the facility may be left to other engineers
hydraulic engineering is concerned with the flow and conveyance of fluids principally water this area of civil engineering is intimately related to the design of pipelines water supply network drainage facilities  including bridges dams channels culverts levees storm sewers  and canals hydraulic engineers design these facilities using the concepts of fluid pressure fluid statics fluid dynamics and hydraulics among others
structural engineering
structural engineering is concerned with the structural design and structural analysis of buildings bridges towers flyovers  overpasses  tunnels off shore structures like oil and gas fields in the sea aerostructure and other structures this involves identifying the loads which act upon a structure and the forces and stresses which arise within that structure due to those loads and then designing the structure to successfully support and resist those loads the loads can be self weight of the structures other dead load live loads moving  wheel  load wind load earthquake load load from temperature change etc the structural engineer must design structures to be safe for their users and to successfully fulfill the function they are designed for  to be serviceable  due to the nature of some loading conditions sub-disciplines within structural engineering have emerged including wind engineering and earthquake engineering
design considerations will include strength stiffness and stability of the structure when subjected to loads which may be static such as furniture or self-weight or dynamic such as wind seismic crowd or vehicle loads or transitory such as temporary construction loads or impact other considerations include cost constructability safety aesthetics and sustainability
surveying
surveying is the process by which a surveyor measures certain dimensions that occur on or near the surface of the earth surveying equipment such as levels and theodolites are used for accurate measurement of angular deviation horizontal vertical and slope distances with computerisation electronic distance measurement  edm  total stations gps surveying and laser scanning have to a large extent supplanted traditional instruments data collected by survey measurement is converted into a graphical representation of the earth s surface in the form of a map this information is then used by civil engineers contractors and realtors to design from build on and trade respectively elements of a structure must be sized and positioned in relation to each other and to site boundaries and adjacent structures although surveying is a distinct profession with separate qualifications and licensing arrangements civil engineers are trained in the basics of surveying and mapping as well as geographic information systems surveyors also lay out the routes of railways tramway tracks highways roads pipelines and streets as well as position other infrastructure such as harbors before construction
in the united states canada the united kingdom and most commonwealth countries land surveying is considered to be a separate and distinct profession land surveyors are not considered to be engineers and have their own professional associations and licensing requirements the services of a licensed land surveyor are generally required for boundary surveys  to establish the boundaries of a parcel using its legal description  and subdivision plans  a plot or map based on a survey of a parcel of land with boundary lines drawn inside the larger parcel to indicate the creation of new boundary lines and roads  both of which are generally referred to as cadastral surveying
construction surveying is generally performed by specialised technicians unlike land surveyors the resulting plan does not have legal status construction surveyors perform the following tasks 
transportation engineering
transportation engineering is concerned with moving people and goods efficiently safely and in a manner conducive to a vibrant community this involves specifying designing constructing and maintaining transportation infrastructure which includes streets canals highways rail systems airports ports and mass transit it includes areas such as transportation design transportation planning traffic engineering some aspects of urban engineering queueing theory pavement engineering intelligent transportation system  its  and infrastructure management
forensic engineering
forensic engineering is the investigation of materials products structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended causing personal injury or damage to property the consequences of failure are dealt with by the law of product liability the field also deals with retracing processes and procedures leading to accidents in operation of vehicles or machinery the subject is applied most commonly in civil law cases although it may be of use in criminal law cases generally the purpose of a forensic engineering investigation is to locate cause or causes of failure with a view to improve performance or life of a component or to assist a court in determining the facts of an accident it can also involve investigation of intellectual property claims especially patents
municipal or urban engineering
municipal engineering is concerned with municipal infrastructure this involves specifying designing constructing and maintaining streets sidewalks water supply networks sewers street lighting municipal solid waste management and disposal storage depots for various bulk materials used for maintenance and public works  salt sand etc  public parks and cycling infrastructure in the case of underground utility networks it may also include the civil portion  conduits and access chambers  of the local distribution networks of electrical and telecommunications services it can also include the optimizing of waste collection and bus service networks some of these disciplines overlap with other civil engineering specialties however municipal engineering focuses on the coordination of these infrastructure networks and services as they are often built simultaneously and managed by the same municipal authority municipal engineers may also design the site civil works for large buildings industrial plants or campuses  ie access roads parking lots potable water supply treatment or pretreatment of waste water site drainage etc 
control engineering
control engineering  or control systems engineering  is the branch of civil engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors the practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled  often a vehicle  and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance when a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control  such as cruise control for regulating a car s speed  multidisciplinary in nature control systems engineering activities focus on implementation of control systems mainly derived by mathematical modeling of systems of a diverse range
