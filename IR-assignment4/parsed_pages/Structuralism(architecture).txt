structuralism (architecture) - wikipedia
structuralism is a movement in architecture and urban planning evolved around the middle of the 20th century it was a reaction to ciam-functionalism  rationalism   which had led to a lifeless expression of urban planning that ignored the identity of the inhabitants and urban forms
structuralism in a general sense is a mode of thought of the 20th century which came about in different places at different times and in different fields it can also be found in linguistics anthropology philosophy and art at the beginning of the general article structuralism the following explanations are noted 
 structuralism is a theoretical paradigm emphasizing that elements of culture must be understood in terms of their relationship to a larger overarching system or structure 
alternately as summarized by philosopher simon blackburn  structuralism is the belief that phenomena of human life are not intelligible except through their interrelations these relations constitute a structure and behind local variations in the surface phenomena there are constant laws of abstract culture 


structuralism as parallel movement to postmodernism
in europe structuralism is seen as a parallel movement to american postmodern architecture the first interpretations of both movements came up in the 1960s through publications and presentations by authors such as charles jencks robert venturi and denise scott brown postmodern architecture was successful throughout the world for decades while postmodernism is concerned with an architectural style many aspects of architecture and urbanism are treated in the structuralist movement
in contrast to the postmodern movement structuralism has developed more slowly less noticeably during several periods in the last decades the theoretical contributions of structuralism were developed in europe japan us and canada in 2011 the first comprehensive compilation of structuralist activity appeared in a publication called  structuralism reloaded  in this extensive book articles by 47 international authors were published about philosophical historical artistic and other relevant aspects the selecting process for all these different views including what is more or less important needs time to give a definitive overall picture of structuralism the following parts of this article are based on the current state of the publication  structuralism reloaded 
a few months after publishing this book the riba institute in london discussed the new candidates for the riba gold medal in 2012 an actual question was   should the venturis be given this year s riba gold medal   surprisingly enough the riba-committee did not award the venturis with their postmodernist view and instead gave herman hertzberger the prize for his structuralist architecture and theoretical contributions the times had changed and a shift in emphasis had occurred the comment of the former riba president jack pringle was   the royal gold medal britain s most prestigious award should go to an architect that has taken us forward not backwards  today postmodern architecture can be compared to some degree with the architectural movement traditionalismus in europe
various movements and directions
the anthropologist claude l vi-strauss remarked   i do not believe that we can still speak of one structuralism there were a lot of movements that claimed to be structuralist  this diversity can also be found in architecture however architectural structuralism has an autonomy that does not comply with all the principles of structuralism in human sciences in architecture the different directions have created different images in this article two directions are discussed sometimes these occur in combination
on the one hand there is the aesthetics of number  which was formulated by aldo van eyck in 1959 this concept can be compared to cellular tissue the most influential prototype of this direction is the orphanage in amsterdam by aldo van eyck completed in 1960 the aesthetics of number can also be described as spatial configurations in architecture or mat-building  alison smithson 
on the other hand there is the architecture of lively variety  structure and coincidence  which was formulated for user participation in housing by john habraken in 1961 also in the 1960s many well-known utopian projects  were based on the principle of structure and coincidence the most influential prototype of this direction is the yamanashi culture chamber in kofu by kenzo tange completed in 1967 similar notions of architecture of lively variety are  architecture of diversity pluralistic architecture two-components-approach or open structures
origins
structuralism in architecture and urban planning had its origins in the congr s international d architecture moderne  ciam  after world war ii between 1928 and 1959 the ciam was an important platform for the discussion of architecture and urbanism various groups with often conflicting views were active in this organization  for example members with a scientific approach to architecture without aesthetic premises  rationalists  members who regarded architecture as an art form  le corbusier  members who were proponents of high- or low-rise building  ernst may  members supporting a course of reform after world war ii  team 10  members of the old guard and so on individual members of the small splinter group team 10 laid the foundations for structuralism the influence of this team was later interpreted by second generation protagonist herman hertzberger when he said   i am a product of team 10  as a group of avant-garde architects team 10 was active from 1953 to 1981 and two different movements emerged from it  the new brutalism of the english members  alison and peter smithson  and the structuralism of the dutch members  aldo van eyck and jacob bakema 
outside team 10 other ideas developed that furthered the structuralist movement - influenced by the concepts of louis kahn in the united states kenzo tange in japan and john habraken in the netherlands  with his theory of user participation in housing  herman hertzberger and lucien kroll made important architectural contributions in the field of participation
in 1960 the japanese architect kenzo tange designed his well-known tokyo bay plan reflecting later on the initial phase of that project he said   it was i believe around 1959 or at the beginning of the sixties that i began to think about what i was later to call structuralism  tange also wrote the article  function structure and symbol 1966  in which he describes the transition from a functional to a structural approach in thinking tange considers the period from 1920 to 1960 under the heading of  functionalism  and the time from 1960 onwards under the heading of  structuralism 
le corbusier created several early projects and built prototypes in a structuralist mode some of them dating back to the 1920s although he was criticized by the members of team 10 in the 1950s for certain aspects of his work  urban concept without a  sense of place  and the dark interior streets of the unit   they nevertheless acknowledged him as a great model and creative personality in architecture and art
manifesto
one of the most influential manifestos for the structuralist movement was compiled by aldo van eyck in the architectural magazine forum 7 1959 it was drawn up as the programme for the international congress of architects in otterlo in 1959 the central aspect of this issue of forum was a frontal attack on the dutch representatives of ciam-rationalism who were responsible for the reconstruction work after world war ii  for tactical reasons planners like van tijen van eesteren merkelbach and others were not mentioned  the magazine contains many examples of and statements in favour of a more human form of urban planning this congress in 1959 marks the official start of structuralism although earlier projects and buildings did exist only since 1969 has the term  structuralism  been used in publications in relation to architecture
otterlo congress   participants
some presentations and discussions that took place during the otterlo congress in 1959 are seen as the beginning of structuralism in architecture and urbanism these presentations had an international influence in the book ciam  59 in otterlo the names of the 43 participating architects are listed while the term structuralism in architecture was published for the first time in 1969

definition of the structuralist form
since structuralism has different directions there is more than one definition the theoretical contribution by herman hertzberger belongs to the most interesting versions a recent and often cited statement by hertzberger is   in structuralism one differentiates between a structure with a long life cycle and infills with shorter life cycles  
a more detailed description by hertzberger is published in 1973 it is a structuralist definition in a general sense but also the basis concept for user participation   the fact that we put  form  in a central position with respect to such notions as  space  or  architecture  means in itself no more than a shifting of accent what we are talking about is in fact another notion of form than that which premises a formal and unchanging relationship between object and viewer and maintains this it is not an outward form wrapped around the object that matters to us but form in the sense of inbuilt capacity and potential vehicle of significance form can be filled-in with significance but can also be deprived of it again depending on the use that s made of it through the values we attach to or add to it or which we even deprive it of - all this dependent on the way in which the users and the form react to and play on each other the case we want to put is that it is this capacity to absorb carry and convey significance that defines what form can bring about in the users - and conversely - what the users can bring about in the form what matters is the interaction of form and users what they convey to each other and bring about in each other and how they mutually take possession of each other what we have to aim for is to form the material  of the things we make  in such a way that - as well as answering to the function in the narrower sense - it will be suitable for more purposes and thus it will be able to play as many roles as possible in the service of the various individual users - so that everyone will then be able to react to it for himself interpreting it in his own way annexing it to his familiar environment to which it will then make a contribution  p 56
compared to other directions of structuralism in architecture the following clarifications are noted   in the new architectural movement there is often a tendency to call everything structuralist that resembles a woven texture and has a grid this would be a superficial way of looking at things by nature structuralism is concerned with the configuration of conditioned and polyvalent units of form  spatial communicational constructional or other units  at all urban scales only when the users have taken possession of the structures through contact interpretation or filling-in the details do the structures achieve their full status any architecture that has a tendency to formalism is thus excluded flexible form which has been much discussed is also rejected as a neutral enclosing system since it does not offer the appropriate solution for any spatial programme in the architecture of herman hertzberger structuralist form can be found from the smallest detail up to the most complicated structure whether it is in terms of spatial facade or environmental design  p 56
the next quotation is a definition of structuralism in different fields it also discusses the autonomy of the primary structure   many structuralists would describe a structure roughly in the following terms  it is a complete set of relationships in which the elements can change but in such a way that these remain dependent on the whole and retain their meaning the whole is independent of its relationship to the elements the relationships between the elements are more important than the elements themselves the elements are interchangeable but not the relationships  p 16
theoretical origins principles and aspects
the principle structure and coincidence remains relevant until now both for housing schemes and urban planning for housing schemes the following images were influential  the perspective drawing of the project  fort l empereur  in algiers by le corbusier  1934  and the isometric drawing of the housing scheme  diagoon  in delft by herman hertzberger  1971  at city level important projects were  the tokyo bay plan of kenzo tange  1960  and the fascinating images of the model of the free university of berlin by candilis josic   woods  1963  also worth mentioning are the utopias of metabolism archigram and yona friedman in general instruments for urban structuring are  traffic lines  eg gridiron plans  symmetries squares remarkable buildings rivers seashore green areas hills etc these methods were also used in previous cities
the principle aesthetics of number proved to be less useful for structuring an entire city however exemplary articulated configurations did arise both in architecture and housing schemes the first influential images for this direction aldo van eyck provided with aerial photos of his orphanage in amsterdam  1960  later he built another inspiring configuration for the space centre estec in noordwijk  1989  these two compositions can be counted among the most beautiful  icons  of structuralism
housing estates buildings and projects
different types of structures
aesthetics of number
the term  aesthetics of number  is introduced by aldo van eyck in the architectural magazine forum 7 1959 in his article van eyck showed two works of art  a structuralist painting by the contemporary artist richard paul lohse and a kuba textile  bakuba tissue  by an african artist of the  primitive  culture the combination of these two cultures has a symbolic meaning in the structuralist movement
structure and coincidence   two-components approach   participation
in the 1960s the structuralists criticised the narrowness of the functional principle  form follows function  in historic cities they found solutions for a new form principle  an interpretable adaptable and expandable architecture see below  historic cities - reciprocity of form  in the magazine forum they developed ideas about  polyvalent form and individual interpretations   reciprocity of form  and  participation  in our time the notion  open structures  is also used in discussions
other structures
urban structuring   the art of town planning   overarching structures
historic cities
examples of urban planning and urban structuring about the relation between historic and contemporary architecture le corbusier wrote   i was labelled a revolutionary whereas my greatest teacher was the past my so-called revolutionary ideas are straight out of the history of architecture itself  quotation in  no.2
historic cities   reciprocity of form
in forum 2 1962 jacob bakema made a study on the principle  reciprocity of form  and  participation  especially on the diocletian s palace in split in forum 3 1962 herman hertzberger did research on the roman amphitheatres in arles and lucca later in 1966 the idea of the amphitheatre in arles was taken over by aldo rossi in his book the architecture of the city in 1976 reyner banham presented the ponte vecchio in florence as one of the historic prototypes in his book megastructure
new cities
new cities in the twentieth century the term  urban structuring  is introduced by alison and peter smithson the term  articulations   of the built volume  by herman hertzberger both terms are used as a title of an architectural book
interrelationships between social and built structures  team 10 
de drie hoven residential building for elderly people in amsterdam-slotervaart by herman hertzberger 1974 in the original state the primary megastructure was light grey  prefabricated concrete  and the facade elements dark grey and matt  wood construction  today the original proportions and colors of the facade elements are changed by the intervention of an unknown architect herewith the fine architectural quality of the original building complex has disappeared
