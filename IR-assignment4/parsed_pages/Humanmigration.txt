human migration - wikipedia
human migration is the movement by people from one place to another with the intentions of settling permanently in the new location the movement is often over long distances and from one country to another but internal migration is also possible  indeed this is the dominant form globally migration may be individuals family units or in large groups
nomadic movements are normally not regarded as migrations as there is no intention to settle in the new place and because the movement is generally seasonal only a few nomadic peoples have retained this form of lifestyle in modern times also the temporary movement of people for the purpose of travel tourism pilgrimages or the commute is not regarded as migration in the absence of an intention to live and settle in the visited places


migration statistics
many estimates of statistics in worldwide migration patterns exist
the world bank has published its migration and remittances factbook annually since 2008 the international organisation for migration  iom  has published a yearly world migration report since 1999 the united nations statistics division also keeps a database on worldwide migration recent advances in research on migration via the internet promise better understanding of migration patterns and migration motives
substantial internal migration can also take place within a country either seasonal human migration  mainly related to agriculture and to tourism to urban places  or shifts of population into cities  urbanisation  or out of cities  suburbanisation  studies of worldwide migration patterns however tend to limit their scope to international migration
the world bank s migration and remittances factbook of 2011 lists the following estimates for the year 2010  total number of immigrants  215.8 million or 3.2  of world population in 2013 the percentage of international migrants worldwide increased by 33  with 59  of migrants targeting developed regions almost half of these migrants are women which is one of the most significant migrant-pattern changes in the last half century women migrate alone or with their family members and community even though female migration is largely viewed as associational rather than independent migration emerging studies argue suggest complex and manifold reasons for this
often a distinction is made between voluntary and involuntary migration or between refugees fleeing political conflict or natural disaster vs economic or labour migration but these distinctions are difficult to make and partially subjective as the motivators for migration are often correlated the world bank s report estimates that as of 2010 16.3 million or 7.6  of migrants qualified as refugees at the end of 2012 approximately 15.4 million people were refugees and persons in refugee-like situations - 87  of them found asylum in developing countries
structurally there is substantial south-south and north-north migration ie most emigrants from high-income oecd countries migrate to other high-income countries and a substantial part  estimated at 43   of emigrants from developing countries migrate to other developing countries the united nations population fund says that  hile the north has experienced a higher absolute increase in the migrant stock since 2000  32 million  compared to the south  25 million  the south recorded a higher growth rate between 2000 and 2013 the average annual rate of change of the migrant population in the developing regions  2.3   slightly exceeded that of the developed regions  2.1

remittances ie funds transferred by migrant workers to their home country form a substantial part of the economy of some countries the top ten remittance recipients in 2010 were  estimates in billion us dollar  1 india  55  2.7  of gdp  2 china  51  0.5  of gnp  mexico  22.6  1.8  of gdp  philippines  21.3  7.8  of gdp  france  15.9  0.5  of gdp  germany  11.6  0.2  of gdp  bangladesh  11.1  7.2  of gdp  belgium  10.4  1.9  of gdp  spain  10.2  0.7  of gdp  nigeria  10.0  1.9  of gdp 
the global commission on international migration  gcim  launched in 2003 published a report in 2005 international migration challenges at the global level are addressed through the global forum on migration and development and the global migration group both established in 2006
the united nations reported that 2014 had the highest level of forced migration on record  59.5 million individuals caused by  persecution conflict generalized violence or human rights violations  as compared with 51.2 million in 2013  an increase of 8.3 million  and with 37.5 million a decade prior as of 2015 one of every 122 humans is a refugee internally displaced or seeking asylum national geographic has published 5 maps showing human migrations in progress in 2015 based on the un report
theories for migration for work in the 21st century
overview
there are a number of reasons why people choose to migrate to another country globalisation has increased the demand for workers from other countries in order to sustain national economies known as  economic migrants  these individuals are generally from impoverished developing countries migrating to obtain sufficient income for survival this income is usually sent home to family members in the form of remittances and has become an economic staple in a number of developing countries people also move or are forced to move as a result of conflict human rights violations violence or to escape persecution in 2013 it was estimated that around 51.2 million people fell into this category another reason people move is to gain access to opportunities and services or to escape extreme weather this type of movement is usually from rural to urban areas and is known as  internal migration   socio-cultural and geo-historical factors also play a major role in north africa for example being an immigrant in europe is considered a sign of social prestige moreover there are many countries which were former european colonies this means that many have relatives that live legally in europe who often constitute an important help for immigrants who have just arrived in a european country relatives might help with job research and accommodation the geographical proximity of africa to europe and the long historical ties between northern and southern mediterranean countries also prompt many to migrate
there are a number of theories to explain the international flow of capital and people from one country to another
neoclassical economic theory
this theory of migration states that the main reason for labour migration is wage difference between two geographic locations these wage differences are usually linked to geographic labour demand and supply it can be said that areas with a shortage of labour but an excess of capital have a high relative wage while areas with a high labour supply and a dearth of capital have a low relative wage labour tends to flow from low-wage areas to high-wage areas often with this flow of labour comes changes in the sending as well as the receiving country neoclassical economic theory is best used to describe transnational migration because it is not confined by international immigration laws and similar governmental regulations
dual labour market theory
dual labour market theory states that migration is mainly caused by pull factors in more developed countries this theory assumes that the labour markets in these developed countries consist of two segments  tertiary which requires high-skilled labour and primary which is very labour-intensive but requires low-skilled workers this theory assumes that migration from less developed countries into more developed countries is a result of a pull created by a need for labour in the developed countries in their secondary market migrant workers are needed to fill the lowest rung of the labour market because the native labourers do not want to do these jobs as they present a lack of mobility this creates a need for migrant workers furthermore the initial dearth in available labour pushes wages up making migration even more enticing a rapid change can be diagnosed in 21st century when labours from less developed countries are treated as high-skilled immigrants a they play a crucial role in tertiary segment
new economics of labor migration
this theory states that migration flows and patterns cannot be explained solely at the level of individual workers and their economic incentives but that wider social entities must be considered as well one such social entity is the household migration can be viewed as a result of risk aversion on the part of a household that has insufficient income the household in this case is in need of extra capital that can be achieved through remittances sent back by family members who participate in migrant labor abroad these remittances can also have a broader effect on the economy of the sending country as a whole as they bring in capital recent research has examined a decline in us interstate migration from 1991 to 2011 theorizing that the reduced interstate migration is due to a decline in the geographic specificity of occupations and an increase in workers  ability to learn about other locations before moving there through both information technology and inexpensive travel other researchers find that the location-specific nature of housing is more important than moving costs in determining labour reallocation
relative deprivation theory
relative deprivation theory states that awareness of the income difference between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community is an important factor in migration the incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality in the short run remittances may increase inequality but in the long run they may actually decrease it there are two stages of migration for a worker  first they invest in human capital formation and then they try to capitalise on their investments in this way successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success
world systems theory
world systems theory looks at migration from a global perspective it explains that interaction between different societies can be an important factor in social change within societies trade with one country which causes economic decline in another may create incentive to migrate to a country with a more vibrant economy it can be argued that even after decolonisation the economic dependence of former colonies still remains on mother countries this view of international trade is controversial however and some argue that free trade can actually reduce migration between developing and developed countries it can be argued that the developed countries import labour-intensive goods which causes an increase in employment of unskilled workers in the less developed countries decreasing the outflow of migrant workers the export of capital-intensive goods from rich countries to poor countries also equalises income and employment conditions thus also slowing migration in either direction this theory can be used to explain migration between countries that are geographically far apart
historical theories
ravenstein
certain laws of social science have been proposed to describe human migration the following was a standard list after ravenstein s  1834-1913  proposal in the 1880s the laws are as follows 
lee
lee s laws divide factors causing migrations into two groups of factors  push and pull factors push factors are things that was are unfavourable about the area that one lives in and pull factors are things that attract one to another area

climate cycles
the modern field of climate history suggests that the successive waves of eurasian nomadic movement throughout history have had their origins in climatic cycles which have expanded or contracted pastureland in central asia especially mongolia and the altai people were displaced from their home ground by other tribes trying to find land that could be grazed by essential flocks each group pushing the next further to the south and west into the highlands of anatolia the pannonian plain into mesopotamia or southwards into the rich pastures of china bogumil terminski uses the term  migratory domino effect  to describe this process in the context of sea people invasion
