reproductive rights - wikipedia
reproductive rights are legal rights and freedoms relating to reproduction and reproductive health the world health organization defines reproductive rights as follows 
women s reproductive rights may include some or all of the following  the right to legal and safe abortion  the right to birth control  freedom from coerced sterilization and contraception  the right to access good-quality reproductive healthcare  and the right to education and access in order to make free and informed reproductive choices reproductive rights may also include the right to receive education about sexually transmitted infections and other aspects of sexuality and protection from practices such as female genital mutilation  fgm 
reproductive rights began to develop as a subset of human rights at the united nation s 1968 international conference on human rights the resulting non binding proclamation of teheran was the first international document to recognize one of these rights when it stated that   parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children  states though have been slow in incorporating these rights in internationally legally binding instruments thus while some of these rights have already been recognized in hard law that is in legally binding international human rights instruments others have been mentioned only in non binding recommendations and therefore have at best the status of soft law in international law while a further group is yet to be accepted by the international community and therefore remains at the level of advocacy
issues related to reproductive rights are some of the most vigorously contested rights  issues worldwide regardless of the population s socioeconomic level religion or culture
the issue of reproductive rights is frequently presented as being of vital importance in discussions and articles by population concern organizations such as population matters
reproductive rights are a subset of sexual and reproductive health and rights


history
proclamation of teheran
in 1945 the united nations charter included the obligation  to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without discrimination as to race sex language or religion  however the charter did not define these rights three years later the un adopted the universal declaration of human rights  udhr  the first international legal document to delineate human rights  the udhr does not mention reproductive rights reproductive rights began to appear as a subset of human rights in the 1968 proclamation of teheran which states   parents have a basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and the spacing of their children 
this right was affirmed by the un general assembly in the 1969 declaration on social progress and development which states  the family as a basic unit of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members particularly children and youth should be assisted and protected so that it may fully assume its responsibilities within the community parents have the exclusive right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children  the 1975 un international women s year conference echoed the proclamation of teheran
cairo programme of action
the twenty-year  cairo programme of action  was adopted in 1994 at the international conference on population and development  icpd  in cairo the non-binding programme of action asserted that governments have a responsibility to meet individuals  reproductive needs rather than demographic targets it recommended that family planning services be provided in the context of other reproductive health services including services for healthy and safe childbirth care for sexually transmitted infections and post-abortion care the icpd also addressed issues such as violence against women sex trafficking and adolescent health the cairo program is the first international policy document to define reproductive health stating 
unlike previous population conferences a wide range of interests from grassroots to government level were represented in cairo 179 nations attended the icpd and overall eleven thousand representatives from governments ngos international agencies and citizen activists participated the icpd did not address the far-reaching implications of the hiv aids epidemic in 1999 recommendations at the icpd 5 were expanded to include commitment to aids education research and prevention of mother-to-child transmission as well as to the development of vaccines and microbicides
the cairo programme of action was adopted by 184 un member states nevertheless many latin american and islamic states made formal reservations to the programme in particular to its concept of reproductive rights and sexual freedom to its treatment of abortion and to its potential incompatibility with islamic law
beijing platform
the 1995 fourth world conference on women in beijing in its non-binding declaration and platform for action supported the cairo programme s definition of reproductive health but established a broader context of reproductive rights 
the beijing platform demarcated twelve interrelated critical areas of the human rights of women that require advocacy the platform framed women s reproductive rights as  indivisible universal and inalienable human rights 
the yogyakarta principles
the yogyakarta principles on the application of international human rights law in relation to sexual orientation and gender identity proposed by a group of experts in november 2006 but not yet incorporated by states in international law declares in its preamble that  the international community has recognized the rights of persons to decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality including sexual and reproductive health free from coercion discrimination and violence  in relation to reproductive health principle 9 on  the right to treatment with humanity while in detention  requires that  states shall rovide adequate access to medical care and counseling appropriate to the needs of those in custody recognizing any particular needs of persons on the basis of their sexual orientation and gender identity including with regard to reproductive health access to hiv aids information and therapy and access to hormonal or other therapy as well as to gender-reassignment treatments where desired  nonetheless african caribbean and islamic countries as well as the russian federation have objected to the use of these principles as human rights standards
other
the first legal textbook on reproductive rights law cases on reproductive rights and justice by melissa murray and kristin luker was published in 2015 by foundation press
state abuses
state abuses against reproductive rights have happened both under right-wing and left-wing governments such abuses include attempts to forcefully increase the birth rate - one of the most notorious natalist policies of the 20th century was that which occurred in communist romania in the period of 1967-1990 during communist leader nicolae ceau escu who adopted a very aggressive natalist policy which included outlawing abortion and contraception routine pregnancy tests for women taxes on childlessness and legal discrimination against childless people - as well as attempts to decrease the fertility rate - china s one child policy  1978-2015  state mandated forced marriage was also practiced by authoritarian governments as a way to meet population targets  the khmer rouge regime in cambodia systematically forced people into marriages in order to increase the population and continue the revolution some governments have implemented eugenic policies of forced sterilizations of  undesirable  population groups such policies were carried out against ethnic minorities in europe and north america in the first half of the 20th century and more recently in latin america against the indigenous population in the 1990s  in peru president alberto fujimori  in office from 1990 to 2000  has been accused of genocide and crimes against humanity as a result of a sterilization program put in place by his administration targeting indigenous people  mainly the quechuas and the aymaras 
prohibition of forced sterilization and forced abortion
the istanbul convention the first legally binding instrument in europe in the field of violence against women and domestic violence prohibits forced sterilization and forced abortion 
human rights
since most existing legally binding international human rights instruments do not explicitly mention sexual and reproductive rights a broad coalition of ngos civil servants and experts working in international organizations have been promoting a reinterpretation of those instruments to link the realization of the already internationally recognized human rights with the realization of reproductive rights an example of this linkage is provided by the 1994 cairo programme of action 
similarly amnesty international has argued that the realisation of reproductive rights is linked with the realisation of a series of recognised human rights including the right to health the right to freedom from discrimination the right to privacy and the right not to be subjected to torture or ill-treatment however not all states have accepted the inclusion of reproductive rights in the body of internationally recognized human rights at the cairo conference several states made formal reservations either to the concept of reproductive rights or to its specific content ecuador for instance stated that 
similar reservations were made by argentina dominican republic el salvador honduras malta nicaragua paraguay peru and the holy see islamic countries such as brunei djibouti iran jordan kuwait libya syria united arab emirates and yemen made broad reservations against any element of the programme that could be interpreted as contrary to the sharia guatemala even questioned whether the conference could legally proclaim new human rights
women s rights
the united nations population fund  unfpa  and the world health organization  who  advocate for reproductive rights with a primary emphasis on women s rights in this respect the un and who focus on a range of issues from access to family planning services sex education menopause and the reduction of obstetric fistula to the relationship between reproductive health and economic status
the reproductive rights of women are advanced in the context of the right to freedom from discrimination and the social and economic status of women the group development alternatives with women for a new era  dawn  explained the link in the following statement 
women s reproductive rights have long retained key issue status in the debate on overpopulation
attempts have been made to analyse the socioeconomic conditions that affect the realisation of a woman s reproductive rights the term reproductive justice has been used to describe these broader social and economic issues proponents of reproductive justice argue that while the right to legalized abortion and contraception applies to everyone these choices are only meaningful to those with resources and that there is a growing gap between access and affordability
men s rights
men s reproductive rights have been claimed by various organizations both for issues of reproductive health and other rights related to sexual reproduction
three international issues in men s reproductive health are sexually transmitted diseases cancer and exposure to toxins
recently men s reproductive right with regards to paternity have become subject of debate in the us the term  male abortion  was coined by melanie mcculley a south carolina attorney in a 1998 article the theory begins with the premise that when a woman becomes pregnant she has the option of abortion adoption or parenthood  it argues in the context of legally recognized gender equality that in the earliest stages of pregnancy the putative  alleged  father should have the right to relinquish all future parental rights and financial responsibility leaving the informed mother with the same three options this concept has been supported by a former president of the feminist organization national organization for women attorney karen decrow the feminist argument for male reproductive choice contends that the uneven ability to choose experienced by men and women in regards to parenthood is evidence of a state-enforced coercion favoring traditional sex roles
in 2006 the national center for men brought a case in the us dubay v wells  dubbed by some  roe v wade for men   that argued that in the event of an unplanned pregnancy when an unmarried woman informs a man that she is pregnant by him he should have an opportunity to give up all paternity rights and responsibilities supporters argue that this would allow the woman time to make an informed decision and give men the same reproductive rights as women in its dismissal of the case the us court of appeals  sixth circuit  stated that  the fourteenth amendment does not deny to  state the power to treat different classes of persons in different ways 
the opportunity to give men the right for a paper abortion is heavily discussed
intersex and reproductive rights
intersex in humans and other animals is a variation in sex characteristics including chromosomes gonads or genitals that do not allow an individual to be distinctly identified as male or female such variation may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than xy-male and xx-female intersex persons are often subjected to involuntary  sex normalizing  surgical and hormonal treatments in infancy and childhood often also including sterilization
un agencies have begun to take note on 1 february 2013 juan e mend s the un special rapporteur on torture and other cruel inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment issued a statement condemning non-consensual surgical intervention on intersex people his report stated  children who are born with atypical sex characteristics are often subject to irreversible sex assignment involuntary sterilization involuntary genital normalizing surgery performed without their informed consent or that of their parents  in an attempt to fix their sex  leaving them with permanent irreversible infertility and causing severe mental suffering  in may 2014 the world health organization issued a joint statement on eliminating forced coercive and otherwise involuntary sterilization an interagency statement with the ohchr un women unaids undp unfpa and unicef the report references the involuntary surgical  sex-normalising or other procedures  on  intersex persons  it questions the medical necessity of such treatments patients  ability to consent and a weak evidence base the report recommends a range of guiding principles to prevent compulsory sterilization in medical treatment including ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making ensuring non-discrimination accountability and access to remedies
youth rights and access
youth are often denied equal access to reproductive health services because health workers view adolescent sexual activity as unacceptable or see sex education as the responsibility of parents providers of reproductive health have little accountability to youth clients a primary factor in denying youth access to reproductive health care
africa
many unintended pregnancies stem from traditional contraceptive methods or no contraceptive measures
youth sexual education in uganda is relatively low comprehensive sex education is not generally taught in schools  even if it was the majority of young people do not stay in school after the age of fifteen so information would be limited regardless
africa experiences high rates of unintended pregnancy along with high rates of hiv aids young women aged 15 24 are eight times more likely to have hiv aids than young men attempted abortions and unsafe abortions are a risk for youth in africa on average there are 2.4 million unsafe abortions in east africa 1.8 million in western africa over 900,000 in middle africa and over 100,000 in southern africa each year
in uganda abortion is illegal except to save the mother s life however 78  of teenagers report knowing someone who has had an abortion and the police do not always prosecute everyone who has an abortion an estimated 22  of all maternal deaths in the area stem from illegal unsafe abortions
european union
over 85  of european women  all ages  have used some form of birth control in their lives europeans as an aggregate report using the pill and condoms as the most commonly used contraceptives
family planning has become prominent throughout the region and most taboos concerning sexuality have been lifted or diminished youth sexual and reproductive health centers have been established across most of the region in sweden approximately 80  of girls and 17  of boys have visited these youth centers which provide all or nearly all services youth need at little to no charge sweden has the highest percentage of lifetime contraceptive use with 96  of its inhabitants claiming to have used birth control at some point in their life sweden also has a high self-reported rate of postcoital pill use a 2007 anonymous survey of swedish 18-year-olds showed that three out of four youth were sexually active with 5  reporting having had an abortion and 4  reporting the contraction of an sti similar centers exist in estonia finland and portugal
views on sexual practice vary throughout the region for example in the united kingdom  uk  sex among youth is generally looked down upon and seen as a problem in need of solution in the netherlands sex between youth is viewed as normal and therefore not discussed in terms of solutions but rather in terms of ensuring safe practices that being said the uk tends to focus on stopping sexual behavior while the netherlands focuses on building self-esteem and healthy relationships
latin america
in ecuador education and class play a large role in the definition of which young women become pregnant and which do not - 50  of young women who are illiterate get pregnant compared to 11  of girls with secondary education the same is true for poorer individuals - 28  become impregnated while only 11  of young women in wealthier households do furthermore access to reproductive rights including contraceptives are limited due to age and the perception of female morality health care providers often discuss contraception theoretically not as a device to be used on a regular basis decisions concerning sexual activity often involve secrecy and taboos as well as a lack of access to accurate information even more telling young women have much easier access to maternal healthcare than they do to contraceptive help which helps explain high pregnancy rates in the region
rates of adolescent pregnancy in latin america number over a million each year
jordan
in jordan there is essentially no sex education in the school system  even when curriculum includes information about sexual issues teachers are apt to skim over it for fear of upsetting parents or being uncomfortable youth in the country desire comprehensive correct and precise information from healthcare providers although they rarely report experiencing that many youth equate reproductive health with maternal health not recognizing the connections to themselves before pregnancy
accessibility and availability of clinics in jordan vary depending on location some villagers have a hard time making it to clinics due to the high cost of transportation and the distance that must be covered health care centers are often overcrowded and understaffed with limited hours of operation youth report long wait times and unhygienic conditions at clinics personal experiences with health care workers vary with some youth feeling as though they received disrespectful and unfair treatment
united states
among sexually experienced teenagers 78  of teenage females and 85  of teenage males used contraception the first time they had sex  86  and 93  of these same females and males respectively reported using contraception the last time they had sex the male condom is the most commonly used method during first sex although 54  of young women in america rely upon the pill
young people in the united states are no more sexually active than individuals in other developed countries but they are significantly less knowledgeable about contraception and safe sex practices as of 2006 only twenty states required sex education in schools - of these only ten required information about contraception on the whole less than 10  of american students receive sex education that includes topical coverage of abortion homosexuality relationships pregnancy and sti prevention abstinence-only education was used throughout much of the united states in the 1990s and early 2000s based upon the moral principle that sex outside of marriage is unacceptable the programs often misled students about their rights to have sex the consequences and prevention of pregnancy and stis
according to 2006 statistics one in three people in the us will contract an sti by the age of 24 and by the age of 20 forty percent of women have been pregnant according to the center for disease control young people ages 15 24 account for 50  of all new stis the most prevalent being hpv and chlamydia family planning in the united states can be expensive and often not covered by insurance plans however effective beginning september 23 2010 following the passage of the affordable care act preventative services including contraception and sti screenings and counseling are available to all insured women with no co-pay
in 24 states legislation was passed that required women who were seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound at least 24 hours before their abortion in addition to the ultrasound requirement several states such as texas have passed legislation requiring facilities that provide abortions to be classified as ambulatory surgery centers despite the very low rates of abortion complications each year many people view this type of legislation as a way to discourage women from getting abortions the us supreme court has struck down texas  most recent law that would have reduced the number of facilities able to give abortions to only eight in the state
gender equality and violence against women
addressing issues of gender-based violence is crucial for attaining reproductive rights the united nations population fund refers to  equality and equity for men and women to enable individuals to make free and informed choices in all spheres of life free from discrimination based on gender  and  sexual and reproductive security including freedom from sexual violence and coercion and the right to privacy  as part of achieving reproductive rights and states that the right to liberty and security of the person which is fundamental to reproductive rights obliges states to 
the who states 
amnesty international writes that 
one key issue for achieving reproductive rights is criminalization of sexual violence if a woman is not protected from forced sexual intercourse she is not protected from forced pregnancy namely pregnancy from rape in order for a woman to be able to have reproductive rights she must have the right to choose with whom and when to reproduce  and first of all decide whether when and under what circumstances to be sexually active in many countries these rights of women are not respected because women do not have a choice in regard to their partner with forced marriage and child marriage being common in parts of the world  and neither do they have any rights in regard to sexual activity as many countries do not allow women to refuse to engage in sexual intercourse when they do not want to  because marital rape is not criminalized in those countries  or to engage in consensual sexual intercourse if they want to  because sex outside marriage is illegal in those countries  in addition to legal barriers there are also social barriers because in many countries a complete sexual subordination of a woman to her husband is expected  for instance in one survey 74  of women in mali said that a husband is justified to beat his wife if she refuses to have sex with him  while sexual romantic relations disapproved by family members or generally sex outside marriage can result in serious violence such as honor killings
hiv aids
according to the cdc  hiv stands for human immunodeficiency virus it weakens a person s immune system by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection no effective cure exists for hiv but with proper medical care hiv can be controlled  hiv amelioration is an important aspect of reproductive rights because the virus can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy or birth or via breast milk
the who states that   all women including those with hiv have the right  to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of their children and to have access to the information education and means to enable them to exercise these rights   the reproductive rights of people living with hiv and their health are very important the link between hiv and reproductive rights exists in regard to four main issues 
issues
cairo programme of action implementation
implementation of the cairo programme of action varies considerably from country to country in many countries post-icpd tensions emerged as the human rights-based approach was implemented since the icpd many countries have broadened their reproductive health programs and attempted to integrate maternal and child health services with family planning more attention is paid to adolescent health and the consequences of unsafe abortion lara knudsen observes that the icpd succeeded in getting feminist language into governments  and population agencies  literature but in many countries the underlying concepts are not widely put into practice in two preparatory meetings for the icpd 10 in asia and latin america the united states under the george w bush administration was the only nation opposing the icpd s programme of action
abortion
lara knudsen a pro-choice activist has suggested that  twenty percent of all pregnancies worldwide end in abortion and nearly half of those abortions are unsafe and often illegal  according to the who more than 45 million  legal and illegal  abortions take place annually at the same time approximately 66,500 women die from the complications of unsafe abortion every year
an article from the world health organization calls safe legal abortion a  fundamental right of women irrespective of where they live  and unsafe abortion a  silent pandemic  the article states  ending the silent pandemic of unsafe abortion is an urgent public-health and human-rights imperative  it also states  access to safe abortion improves women s health and vice versa as documented in romania during the regime of president nicolae ceau escu  and  legalisation of abortion on request is a necessary but insufficient step toward improving women s health  citing that in some countries such as india where abortion has been legal for decades access to competent care remains restricted because of other barriers who s global strategy on reproductive health adopted by the world health assembly in may 2004 noted   as a preventable cause of maternal mortality and morbidity unsafe abortion must be dealt with as part of the mdg on improving maternal health and other international development goals and targets   the who s development and research training in human reproduction  hrp  whose research concerns people s sexual and reproductive health and lives has an overall strategy to combat unsafe abortion that comprises four inter-related activities 
when negotiating the cairo programme of action at the 1994 international conference on population and development  icpd  the issue was so contentious that delegates eventually decided to omit any recommendation to legalize abortion instead advising governments to provide proper post-abortion care and to invest in programs that will decrease the number of unwanted pregnancies
on april 18 2008 the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe a group comprising members from 47 european countries adopted a resolution calling for the decriminalization of abortion within reasonable gestational limits and guaranteed access to safe abortion procedures the nonbinding resolution was passed on april 16 by a vote of 102 to 69
during and after the icpd some interested parties attempted to interpret the term  reproductive health  in the sense that it implies abortion as a means of family planning or indeed a right to abortion these interpretations however do not reflect the consensus reached at the conference for the european union where legislation on abortion is certainly less restrictive than elsewhere the council presidency has clearly stated that the council s commitment to promote  reproductive health  did not include the promotion of abortion likewise the european commission in response to a question from a member of the european parliament clarified 
 the term  reproductive health  was defined by the united nations  un  in 1994 at the cairo international conference on population and development all member states of the union endorsed the programme of action adopted at cairo the union has never adopted an alternative definition of  reproductive health  to that given in the programme of action which makes no reference to abortion 
with regard to the us it should be noted that only a few days prior to the cairo conference the head of the us delegation vice president al gore had stated for the record 
 let us get a false issue off the table  the us does not seek to establish a new international right to abortion and we do not believe that abortion should be encouraged as a method of family planning 
some years later the position of the us administration in this debate was reconfirmed by us ambassador to the un ellen sauerbrey when she stated at a meeting of the un commission on the status of women that   nongovernmental organizations are attempting to assert that beijing in some way creates or contributes to the creation of an internationally recognized fundamental right to abortion  she added   there is no fundamental right to abortion and yet it keeps coming up largely driven by ngos trying to hijack the term and trying to make it into a definition 
collaborative research from the institute of development studies states that  access to safe abortion is a matter of human rights democracy and public health and the denial of such access is a major cause of death and impairment with significant costs to  development  the research highlights the inequities of access to safe abortion both globally and nationally and emphasises the importance of global and national movements for reform to address this the shift by campaigners of reproductive rights from an issue-based agenda  the right to abortion  to safe legal abortion not only as a human right but bound up with democratic and citizenship rights has been an important way of reframing the abortion debate and reproductive justice agenda
meanwhile however the european court of human rights settled the question through a landmark judgment  case of a b and c v ireland  in which it is stated that the european convention on human rights does not contain a right to abortion
population control
compulsory or forced sterilizations and abortions may also occur in the context of population control policies from the 1970s to 1980s tension grew between women s health activists who advance women s reproductive rights as part of a human rights-based approach on the one hand and population control advocates on the other at the 1984 un world population conference in mexico city population control policies came under attack from women s health advocates who argued that the policies  narrow focus led to coercion and decreased quality of care and that these policies ignored the varied social and cultural contexts in which family planning was provided in developing countries in the 1980s the hiv aids epidemic forced a broader discussion of sex into the public discourse in many countries leading to more emphasis on reproductive health issues beyond reducing fertility the growing opposition to the narrow population control focus led to a significant departure in the early 1990s from past population control policies in the united states abortion opponents have begun to foment conspiracy theories about reproductive rights advocates accusing them of advancing a racist agenda of eugenics and of trying to reduce the african american birth rate in the us
sperm donation
laws in many countries and states require sperm donors to be either anonymous or known to the recipient or the laws restrict the number of children each donor may father although many donors choose to remain anonymous new technologies such as the internet and dna technology have opened up new avenues for those wishing to know more about the biological father siblings and half-siblings
compulsory sterilization
during the 20th century forced sterilization of roma women in european countries especially in former communist countries was practiced and there are allegations that these practices continue unofficially in some countries such as czech republic bulgaria hungary and romania in v c vs slovakia the european court for human rights ruled in favor of a roma woman who was the victim of forced sterilization in a state hospital in slovakia in 2000
an individual s sterilization is one of the main issues behind the reproductive rights that are being ignored by those who believe that they have a right to decide whether certain people are  fit  to have children the mental stability of an individual and the physical defects that an individual might have played an important role in the beginnings of forced sterilization individuals were afraid that these defects were hereditary and wanted to put a stop to it before society became incompetent although there are numerous operations which may render one sterile vasectomy in the male and salpingectomy in the female are considered the least radical neither operation is considered dangerous the laws of the states in which sterilization is practiced vary numerous provisions have been made both by the united states and by individual states for limiting the number of degenerates in this country the creation of voluntary programs such as planned parenthood  presented the use of abstinence and contraceptives as forms of controlling the population growth  were introduced to help families control their birth rate
sterilization has long been a controversial topic in the united states up through the 1970s states could choose which women were allowed the procedure and which women were not eligible this strategy proved repressive both for women who wished to become sterilized and were not granted the right as well as for women who had no choice but to become sterilized then as today sterilization was a form of birth control highly sought after by some women however until the 1960s it was illegal for women to become sterilized for reasons other than eugenics which meant sterilization as birth control was illegal this left many women with highly legitimate reasons for sterilization unable to receive the procedure it also meant most women who were undergoing the procedure were getting it for non-birth control reasons and not by choice
additionally both compulsory and coercive sterilization have become constitutional issues because some argue that it violates an individual s  right to procreate  in 1972 eisenstadt v baird set the precedent   the right of the individual married or single to be free from unwarranted government intrusion into matters so fundamentally affecting a person as the decision to bear or beget a child  yet sterilization is still being used in court sentencing for both men and women in cases involving child abuse and or neglect drug abuse and other criminal activity the relationship between reproductive rights and sterilization is also visible in hospital settings where doctors have been documented as ordering women namely low-income women of color to consent to sterilization or have their birthing services withheld
criticisms
some opponents of legalized abortion view the term  reproductive rights  as a euphemism to sway emotions in favor of abortion national right to life has referred to  reproductive rights  as a  fudge term  and  the code word for abortion rights
