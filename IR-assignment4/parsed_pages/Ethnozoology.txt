ethnozoology - wikipedia
ethnozoology is the study of the past and present interrelationships between human cultures and the animals in their environment it includes classification and naming of zoological forms cultural knowledge and use of wild and domestic animals it is one of the main subdisciplines of ethnobiology and shares many methodologies and theoretical frameworks with ethnobotany
ethnozoology is the study of human and animal interaction ethnobiology includes ethnobotany which concerns the study of human-plant relationships and ethnozoology ethnozoology focuses explicitly on human-animal relationships and knowledge humans have acquired concerning the earth s fauna ethnozoological study concerns the significance of this knowledge to our understanding of the roles played by animals in human society faunal resources play a variety of roles in human life throughout history and their importance to human beings is not only utilitarian but cultural religious artistic and philosophical ethnozoology can be understood broadly from ecological cognitive and symbolic perspectives human knowledge about natural faunal resources entails sensing recognizing classifying living things ethnozoology is a discipline that connects scientific methods to traditional systems of knowledge and cultural beliefs


ethnozoology and conservation
in a broader context ethnozoology and its companion discipline ethnobotany contribute to the larger science of ethnobiology the history of ethnobiology is divided into three periods the pre-classical period which began around 1860 focused on collecting information about humans  use of resources while the classical period which began in 1954 produced anthropological studies on linguistics and biological classifications the current period or post-classical period has been described as a meeting of social science and the study of natural resources
given the profound human influence on faunal biodiversity wildlife conservation planning is becoming increasingly urgent it is widely acknowledged that environmental health is important to human health and biodiversity loss can have both indirect and direct negative effects on human wellbeing the close link between human health and ecological faunal health is substantiated with five important concepts  animals cause and disseminate disease for humans and vice versa animals can be guards of human health animals are used in traditional medicine practices throughout the world animals are a source of drugs and treatments in human diseases and animals are used in medical research
ethnozoology and the social sciences
sociology
sociology has been slow to explore ethnozoology and grant it credibility the study of ethnozoology is important because policy makers and concerned citizens are too often left to be informed only by animal advocates or biomedical researchers both of which are inherently biased animals provide humans with a better understanding of ourselves and how we think and act toward animals has the potential to reveal our attitudes toward other people and social order evidence of this can be seen in the ways that animal images may at times be expressing underlying racism   the most damning testimony given by accused police at the rodney king trial involved characterization of king as a  gorilla   during the gulf war saddam hussein was described in the american press as a  rat   and the actions of people in the los angeles riots were likened by the media commentators to  packs of vicious animals  
sociology is a science concerned with groups under oppression and suffering including african americans studies women s studies and gay lesbian studies but not much attention or legitimacy is awarded animal studies modern use of animals in the developed world especially in the united states can be characterized by exploitation domination and oppression animal cruelty and abuse is not only present in the industrial farming of livestock but also in such circumstances as dog fighting cow tipping horse racing circus acts and other entertainment industries and practices furthermore animals are often victims and pawns used in domestic violence the widespread abuse of animals in modern society is important for sociology because it involves an entrenched assumption about the connection between cruelty toward animals and violence directed and human beings some research has even suggested ways in which the human-animal interaction can challenge dominant sociological theories about the self
anthropology
anthropology has done more to study ethnozoology in terms of the history of the function of animals in non-industrialized societies and the role that animals play symbolically and religiously in different cultures around the world the domestication process has been the chief concern for anthropologists whose interests are in the history of human desire to understand animals enslave them and harness their power animal-derived products have been used especially for food but also for clothing tools toys and for medicinal and magic-religious purposes many cultures associate strong supernatural powers between the animal and human worlds including mythologies and connections with totemic ancestral or magical animals and animal-gods
animals are given symbolic meaning as in the western association of black cats with poor luck biological knowledge varies according to cultural and traditional knowledge and experiences people share a basic way of comprehending the natural world based on common evolutionary history and this foundation connects scientific biology with its historical roots in different cultures  the evolutionary perspective on human cognition and affect indicates some degree of universality in perception and decision-making with regard to the natural world and its fauna the interaction between these aspects of psychology biodiversity of the earth s wildlife and the unique social cultural and economic contexts within which humans interact and develop produces cultural diversity paleoanthropological studies suggest that linguistic approaches to ethnobiology have only recently evolved in the context of human history which suggests that these linguistic approaches only provide a partial understanding to how humans perceive and engage with the natural world around them
