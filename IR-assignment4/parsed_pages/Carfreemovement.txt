car-free movement - wikipedia
the car-free movement is a broad informal emergent network of individuals and organizations including social activists urban planners and others brought together by a shared belief that large and or high-speed motorized vehicles  cars trucks tractor units motorcycles   are too dominant in most modern cities the goal of the movement is to create places where motorized vehicle use is greatly reduced or eliminated to convert road and parking space to other public uses and to rebuild compact urban environments where most destinations are within easy reach by walking cycling or public transport


context
before the twentieth century cities and towns were normally compact containing narrow streets busy with human activity in the early twentieth century many of these settlements were adapted to accommodate the car with wider roads more space allocated for car parking and lower population densities where most space between urban buildings was reserved for automotive use lower population densities led to urban sprawl with longer distances between places and traffic congestion which made the alternatives to the car unattractive or impractical and created the conditions for more traffic and sprawl  the car system was  increasingly able to  drive  out competitors such as feet bikes buses and trains  this process led to changes in urban form and living patterns where it was virtually impossible for people to live without a car
some governments have responded to this emerging situation with policies and regulations aimed at reversing this trend by increasing urban densities encouraging mixed use development reducing space allocated to the private cars and lending greater support to cycling walking and public transport globally cities are planning to increase their public transport and non-motorized transport modal shares and shift away from private transport oriented development cities like hong kong developed a highly integrated public transportation system which effectively reduced the use of private transport in contrast with private automotive travel car sharing where people can easily rent a car for a few hours rather than own one is emerging as an increasingly important element for urban transportation
urban design
proponents of the car-free movement focus on both sustainable transportation options and on urban design zoning school placement policies urban agriculture telecommuting options and housing developments that create proximity or access so that long distance transportation becomes less of a requirement of daily life
new urbanism is an american urban design movement that arose in the early 1980s its goal has been to reform all aspects of real estate development and urban planning from urban retrofits to suburban infill new urbanist neighborhoods are designed to contain a diverse range of housing and jobs and to be walkable
world squares for all is a scheme to remove much of the traffic from major squares in london including trafalgar square and parliament square
car-free cities are as the name implies entire cities  or at least the inner parts therof  which have been made entirely car-free
car-free zones are area of a city or town where use of cars is prohibited or greatly restricted
living streets provide for the needs of car drivers secondarily to the needs of users of the street as a whole they are designed to be shared by pedestrians playing children bicyclists and low-speed motor vehicles
distribution centers help reduce the need to keep buildings such as warehouses in city centers accessible by tractor units they allow the tractor units to unload their products in the distribution center which is placed outside of the city center the products are then placed in a small truck  sometimes electrically powered  freight bicycle  to bridge the last mile  transportation  to the warehouse besides offering advantages to the population  increased safety due to truck drivers having less blind spots  reduced noise traffic reduced tailpipe emissions   it also offers financial advantage for the companies as tractor units require a lot of time to bridge this last mile  they are not very agile in city centers  and the driver is paid by the hour and they also have very high fuel consumption in urban centers there is also less risk of accidents occurring and the associated costs thereon
at the outskirts of towns between the exits of the rings roads and the car-free zones in the city center themselves additional car parking lots can be added generally in the form of underground car parks  to avoid it taking up surface space  careful placement of these car-parking lots is needed though ensuring that they are made far enough from the city centers  and closer to the ring roads  to avoid them attracting more cars to the city center in some instances near these car parking lotss public transport  ie bus  stops are foreseen or bicycle-sharing services are present
community bicycle programs provide bicycles within an urban environment for short term use the first successful scheme was in the 1960s in amsterdam and can now be found in many other cities with 20,000 bicycles introduced to paris in 2007 in the v lib  scheme
advocacy groups
the campaign for better transport  formerly known as transport2000  was formed in 1972 in britain to challenge proposed cuts in the british rail network and since then has promoted public transport solutions to our transport needs
car free walks is a uk-based website encouraging walkers to use public transport to reach the start and end of walks rather than using a car
activism groups
road protests rose to prominence in the uk in the early 1990s in response to a major road building program both in urban communities and also rural areas
reclaim the streets a movement formed in 1991 in london  invaded  major roads highway or freeway to stage parties while this may obstruct the regular users of these spaces such as car drivers and public bus riders the philosophy of rts is that it is vehicle traffic not pedestrians who are causing the obstruction and that by occupying the road they are in fact opening up public space
in flanders the organisation fietsersbond has called upon the government to ban tractor units in city centers
critical mass rides emerged in 1992 in san francisco where cyclists take to the streets en masse to dominate the traffic using the slogan  we are traffic  the ride was founded with the idea of drawing attention to how unfriendly the city was to bicyclists
the world naked bike ride was born in 2001 in spain with the first naked bike rides which then emerged as the wnbr in 2004 a concept which rapidly spread through collaborations with many different activist groups and individuals around the world to promote bicycle transportation renewable energy recreation walkable communities and environmentally responsible sustainable solutions to living in the twenty-first century
parking days started in 2005 when rebar a collaborative group of creators designers and activists based in san francisco transformed a metered parking spot into a small park complete with turf seating and shade and by 2007 there were 180 parks in 27 cities around the world
official events
car free days are official events with the common goal of taking a fair number of cars off the streets of a city or some target area or neighborhood for all or part of a day in order to give the people who live and work there a chance to consider how their city might look and work with significantly fewer cars the first events were organised in reykjav k  iceland  bath  uk  and la rochelle  france  in 1995
in town without my car  is an eu campaign and day every autumn  northern hemisphere  for an increased use of other vehicles than the car it has since spread beyond the eu and in 2004 more than 40 countries participate
world urbanism day was founded in 1949 in buenos aires and is celebrated in more than 30 countries on four continents each november 8
towards carfree cities is the annual conference of the world carfree network and provides a focal point for diverse aspects of the emerging global carfree movement the conference is in portland oregon usa in 2008  its first time in north america  and has also been in istanbul turkey  bogota colombia  budapest hungary  berlin germany  prague czech republic  timisoara romania  and lyon france the conference series attempts to bridge the gap between many of the diverse people and organizations interested in reducing urban dependence on the automobile

carfree development
definitions and types
there are many areas of the world where people have always lived without cars because no road access is possible or none has been provided in developed countries these include islands and some historic neighbourhoods or settlements the largest example being the canal city of venice the term carfree development implies a physical change - either new building or changes to an existing built area
melia et al  2010  define carfree development as follows 
carfree developments are residential or mixed use developments which 
this definition  which they distinguish from the more common  low car development   is based mainly on experience in northwestern europe where the movement for carfree development began within this definition three types are identified 
vauban
vauban freiburg germany is according to this definition the largest carfree development in europe with over 5,000 residents whether it can be considered carfree is open to debate  many local people prefer the term  stellplatzfrei  - literally  free from parking spaces  to describe the traffic management system there vehicles are allowed down the residential streets at walking pace to pick up and deliver but not to park although there are frequent infractions residents of the stellplatzfrei areas must sign an annual declaration stating whether they own a car or not car owners must purchase a place in one of the multi-storey car parks on the periphery run by a council-owned company the cost of these spaces    17,500 in 2006 plus a monthly fee   acts as a disincentive to car ownership
limited access type
the more common form of carfree development involves some sort of physical barrier which prevents motor vehicles from penetrating into a carfree interior melia et al describe this as the  limited access  type in some cases such as stellwerk 60 in cologne there is a removable barrier controlled by a residents  organisations in others such as waterwijk  amsterdam   article in dutch  vehicular access is only available from the exterior
pedestrianised centres
whereas the first two models apply to newly built carfree developments most pedestrianised city town and district centres have been retro-fitted pedestrianised centres may be considered carfree developments where they include a significant number of residents mostly without cars due to new residential development within them or because they already included dwellings when they were pedestrianised the largest example in europe is groningen  city  with a city centre population of 16,500
benefits and problems of carfree developments
several studies have been done on european carfree developments the most comprehensive was conducted in 2000 by jan scheurer other more recent studies have been made of specific carfree areas such as vienna s florisdorf carfree development
the main benefits found for carfree developments  summarised in melia et al 2010  found in the various studies are 
the main problems related to parking management where parking is not controlled in the surrounding area this often results in complaints from neighbours about overspill parking
