environmental impact of shipping - wikipedia
the environmental impact of shipping includes greenhouse gas emissions acoustic and oil pollution the international maritime organization  imo  estimates that carbon dioxide emissions from shipping were equal to 2.2  of the global human-made emissions in 2012 and expects them to rise by as much as 2 to 3 times by 2050 if no action is taken
the first intersessional meeting of the imo working group on greenhouse gas emissions from ships took place in oslo norway on 23 27 june 2008 it was tasked with developing the technical basis for the reduction mechanisms that may form part of a future imo regime to control greenhouse gas emissions from international shipping and a draft of the actual reduction mechanisms themselves for further consideration by imo s marine environment protection committee  mepc 


ballast water
ballast water discharges by ships can have a negative impact on the marine environment
cruise ships large tankers and bulk cargo carriers use a huge amount of ballast water which is often taken on in the coastal waters in one region after ships discharge wastewater or unload cargo and discharged at the next port of call wherever more cargo is loaded ballast water discharge typically contains a variety of biological materials including plants animals viruses and bacteria these materials often include non-native nuisance invasive exotic species that can cause extensive ecological and economic damage to aquatic ecosystems along with serious human health problems
sound pollution
noise pollution caused by shipping and other human enterprises has increased in recent history the noise produced by ships can travel long distances and marine species who may rely on sound for their orientation communication and feeding can be harmed by this sound pollution
the convention on the conservation of migratory species has identified ocean noise as a potential threat to marine life the disruption of whales  ability to communicate with one another is an extreme threat and is affecting their ability to survive according to discovery channel s article on sonic sea journeys deep into the ocean over the last century extremely loud noise from commercial ships oil and gas exploration naval sonar exercises and other sources has transformed the ocean s delicate acoustic habitat challenging the ability of whales and other marine life to prosper and ultimately to survive whales are starting to react to this in ways that are life-threatening kenneth c balcomb a whale researcher and a former us navy officer states that the day march 15 2000 is the day of infamy as discovery says where him and his crew discovered whales swimming dangerously close to the shore they re supposed to be in deep water so i pushed it back out to sea says balcomb although sonar helps to protect us it is destroying marine life according to ifaw animal rescue program director katie moore there s different ways that sounds can affect animals there s that underlying ambient noise level that s rising and rising and rising that interferes with communication and their movement patterns and then there s the more acute kind of traumatic impact of sound that s causing physical damage or a really strong behavioral response it s fight or flight
wildlife collisions
marine mammals such as whales and manatees risk being struck by ships causing injury and death for example if a ship is traveling at a speed of only 15 knots there is a 79 percent chance of a collision being lethal to a whale
one notable example of the impact of ship collisions is the endangered north atlantic right whale of which 400 or less remain the greatest danger to the north atlantic right whale is injury sustained from ship strikes between 1970 and 1999 35.5 percent of recorded deaths were attributed to collisions during 1999 to 2003 incidents of mortality and serious injury attributed to ship strikes averaged one per year in 2004 to 2006 that number increased to 2.6 deaths from collisions has become an extinction threat
atmospheric pollution
exhaust gases from ships are considered to be a significant source of air pollution both for conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases
there is a perception that cargo transport by ship is low in air pollutants because for equal weight and distance it is the most efficient transport method according to shipping researcher amy bows-larkin this is particularly true in comparison to air freight  however because sea shipment accounts for far more annual tonnage and the distances are often large shipping s emissions are globally substantial a difficulty is that the year-on-year increasing amount shipping overwhelms gains in efficiency such as from slow-steaming or the use of kites the growth in tonne-kilometers of sea shipment has averaged 4 percent yearly since the 1990s and it has grown by a factor of 5 since the 1970s there are now over 100,000 transport ships at sea of which about 6,000 are large container ships
conventional pollutants
air pollution from cruise ships is generated by diesel engines that burn high sulfur content fuel oil also known as bunker oil producing sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxide and particulate in addition to carbon monoxide carbon dioxide and hydrocarbons diesel exhaust has been classified by epa as a likely human carcinogen epa recognizes that these emissions from marine diesel engines contribute to ozone and carbon monoxide non-attainment  ie failure to meet air quality standards  as well as adverse health effects associated with ambient concentrations of particulate matter and visibility haze acid deposition and eutrophication and nitrification of water epa estimates that large marine diesel engines accounted for about 1.6 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions and 2.8 percent of mobile source particulate emissions in the united states in 2000 contributions of marine diesel engines can be higher on a port-specific basis ultra-low sulfur diesel  ulsd  is a standard for defining diesel fuel with substantially lowered sulfur contents as of 2006 almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in europe and north america is of a ulsd type
of total global air emissions shipping accounts for 18 to 30 percent of the nitrogen oxide and 9 percent of the sulphur oxides  sulfur in the air creates acid rain which damages crops and buildings when inhaled sulfur is known to cause respiratory problems and even increases the risk of a heart attack according to irene blooming a spokeswoman for the european environmental coalition seas at risk the fuel used in oil tankers and container ships is high in sulfur and cheaper to buy compared to the fuel used for domestic land use  a ship lets out around 50 times more sulfur than a lorry per metric tonne of cargo carried  cities in the us like long beach los angeles houston galveston and pittsburgh see some of the heaviest shipping traffic in the nation and have left local officials desperately trying to clean up the air increasing trade between the us and china is helping to increase the number of vessels navigating the pacific and exacerbating many of the environmental problems to maintain the level of growth china is experiencing large amounts of grain are being shipped to china by the boat load the number of voyages are expected to continue increasing
greenhouse gas pollutants
3.5 to 4 percent of all climate change emissions are caused by shipping primarily carbon dioxide
as one way to reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emissions from shipping vetting agency rightship developed an online  greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions rating  as a systematic way for the industry to compare a ship s co2 emissions with peer vessels of a similar size and type based on the international maritime organisation s  imo  energy efficiency design index  eedi  that applies to ships built from 2013 rightship s ghg rating can also be applied to vessels built prior to 2013 allowing for effective vessel comparison across the world s fleet the ghg rating utilises an a to g scale where a represents the most efficient ships it measures the theoretical amount of carbon dioxide emitted per tonne nautical mile travelled based on the design characteristics of the ship at time of build such as cargo carrying capacity engine power and fuel consumption higher rated ships can deliver significantly lower co2 emissions across the voyage length which means they also use less fuel and are cheaper to run
stress for improvement
one source of environmental stresses on maritime vessels recently has come from states and localities as they assess the contribution of commercial marine vessels to regional air quality problems when ships are docked at port for instance large marine diesel engines are believed to contribute 7 percent of mobile source nitrogen oxide emissions in baton rouge new orleans ships can also have a significant impact in areas without large commercial ports  they contribute about 37 percent of total area nitrogen oxide emissions in the santa barbara area and that percentage is expected to increase to 61 percent by 2015 again there is little cruise-industry specific data on this issue they comprise only a small fraction of the world shipping fleet but cruise ship emissions may exert significant impacts on a local scale in specific coastal areas that are visited repeatedly shipboard incinerators also burn large volumes of garbage plastics and other waste producing ash that must be disposed of incinerators may release toxic emissions as well
in 2005 marpol annex vi came into force to combat this problem as such cruise ships now employ cctv monitoring on the smokestacks as well as recorded measuring via opacity meter while some are also using clean burning gas turbines for electrical loads and propulsion in sensitive areas
oil spills
most commonly associated with ship pollution are oil spills while less frequent than the pollution that occurs from daily operations oil spills have devastating effects while being toxic to marine life polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons  pahs  the components in crude oil are very difficult to clean up and last for years in the sediment and marine environment marine species constantly exposed to pahs can exhibit developmental problems susceptibility to disease and abnormal reproductive cycles one of the more widely known spills was the exxon valdez incident in alaska the ship ran aground and dumped a massive amount of oil into the ocean in march 1989 despite efforts of scientists managers and volunteers over 400,000 seabirds about 1,000 sea otters and immense numbers of fish were killed
international regulation
some of the major international efforts in the form of treaties are the marine pollution treaty honolulu which deals with regulating marine pollution from ships and the un convention on law of the sea which deals with marine species and pollution while plenty of local and international regulations have been introduced throughout maritime history much of the current regulations are considered inadequate  in general the treaties tend to emphasize the technical features of safety and pollution control measures without going to the root causes of sub-standard shipping the absence of incentives for compliance and the lack of enforceability of measures  the most common problems encountered with international shipping arise from paperwork errors and customs brokers not having the proper information about your items cruise ships for example are exempt from regulation under the us discharge permit system  npdes under the clean water act  that requires compliance with technology-based standards in the caribbean many ports lack proper waste disposal facilities and many ships dump their waste at sea
sewage
the cruise line industry dumps 255,000 us gallons  970 m3  of greywater and 30,000 us gallons  110 m3  of blackwater into the sea every day blackwater is sewage wastewater from toilets and medical facilities which can contain harmful bacteria pathogens viruses intestinal parasites and harmful nutrients discharges of untreated or inadequately treated sewage can cause bacterial and viral contamination of fisheries and shellfish beds producing risks to public health nutrients in sewage such as nitrogen and phosphorus promote excessive algal blooms which consumes oxygen in the water and can lead to fish kills and destruction of other aquatic life a large cruise ship  3,000 passengers and crew  generates an estimated 55,000 to 110,000 liters per day of blackwater waste
due to the environmental impact of shipping and sewage in particular marpol annex iv was brought into force september 2003 strictly limiting untreated waste discharge modern cruise ships are most commonly installed with a membrane bioreactor type treatment plant for all blackwater and greywater such as  http   wwwgertsen-olufsencom ship-offshore products g-o brands g-o bioreactoraspx   zenon or rochem which produce near drinkable quality effluent to be re-used in the machinery spaces as technical water
cleaning
greywater is wastewater from the sinks showers galleys laundry and cleaning activities aboard a ship it can contain a variety of pollutant substances including fecal coliforms detergents oil and grease metals organic compounds petroleum hydrocarbons nutrients food waste medical and dental waste sampling done by the epa and the state of alaska found that untreated greywater from cruise ships can contain pollutants at variable strengths and that it can contain levels of fecal coliform bacteria several times greater than is typically found in untreated domestic wastewater greywater has potential to cause adverse environmental effects because of concentrations of nutrients and other oxygen-demanding materials in particular greywater is typically the largest source of liquid waste generated by cruise ships  90 to 95 percent of the total  estimates of greywater range from 110 to 320 liters per day per person or 330,000 to 960,000 liters per day for a 3,000-person cruise ship
solid waste
solid waste generated on a ship includes glass paper cardboard aluminium and steel cans and plastics it can be either non-hazardous or hazardous in nature solid waste that enters the ocean may become marine debris and can then pose a threat to marine organisms humans coastal communities and industries that utilize marine waters cruise ships typically manage solid waste by a combination of source reduction waste minimization and recycling however as much as 75 percent of solid waste is incinerated on board and the ash typically is discharged at sea although some is landed ashore for disposal or recycling marine mammals fish sea turtles and birds can be injured or killed from entanglement with plastics and other solid waste that may be released or disposed off of cruise ships on average each cruise ship passenger generates at least two pounds of non-hazardous solid waste per day with large cruise ships carrying several thousand passengers the amount of waste generated in a day can be massive for a large cruise ship about 8 tons of solid waste are generated during a one-week cruise it has been estimated that 24 percent of the solid waste generated by vessels worldwide  by weight  comes from cruise ships most cruise ship garbage is treated on board  incinerated pulped or ground up  for discharge overboard when garbage must be off-loaded  for example because glass and aluminium cannot be incinerated  cruise ships can put a strain on port reception facilities which are rarely adequate to the task of serving a large passenger vessel
bilge water
on a ship oil often leaks from engine and machinery spaces or from engine maintenance activities and mixes with water in the bilge the lowest part of the hull of the ship but there is a filter to clean bilge water before being discharged oil gasoline and by-products from the biological breakdown of petroleum products can harm fish and wildlife and pose threats to human health if ingested oil in even minute concentrations can kill fish or have various sub-lethal chronic effects bilge water also may contain solid wastes and pollutants containing high levels of oxygen-demanding material oil and other chemicals a typically large cruise ship will generate an average of 8 metric tons of oily bilge water for each 24 hours of operation to maintain ship stability and eliminate potentially hazardous conditions from oil vapors in these areas the bilge spaces need to be flushed and periodically pumped dry however before a bilge can be cleared out and the water discharged the oil that has been accumulated needs to be extracted from the bilge water after which the extracted oil can be reused incinerated and or offloaded in port if a separator which is normally used to extract the oil is faulty or is deliberately bypassed untreated oily bilge water could be discharged directly into the ocean where it can damage marine life a number of cruise lines have been charged with environmental violations related to this issue in recent years
