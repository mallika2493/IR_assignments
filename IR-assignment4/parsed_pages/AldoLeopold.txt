early life
rand aldo leopold was born in burlington iowa on january 11 1887 his father carl leopold was a businessman who made walnut desks  and his mother born clara starker was carl s first cousin charles starker father of clara and uncle of carl was a german immigrant educated in engineering and architecture rand aldo was named after two of carl s business partners c w rand and aldo sommers although the  rand  was eventually dropped the leopold family included younger siblings mary luize carl starker and frederic leopold s first language was german although he mastered english at an early age
aldo leopold s early life was highlighted by the outdoors carl would take his children on excursions into the woods and taught his oldest son woodcraft and hunting aldo showed an aptitude for observation spending hours counting and cataloging birds near his home mary would later say of her older brother  he was very much an outdoorsman even in his extreme youth he was always out climbing around the bluffs or going down to the river or going across the river into the woods  he attended prospect hill elementary where he ranked at the top of his class and then the overcrowded burlington high school every august the family vacationed in michigan at the forested les cheneaux islands in lake huron which the children took to exploring
schooling
in 1900 gifford pinchot who oversaw the newly implemented division of forestry in the department of agriculture donated money to yale university to begin one of the nation s first forestry schools hearing of this development the teenage leopold decided on forestry as a vocation his parents agreed to let him attend the lawrenceville school a preparatory college in new jersey in order to improve his chances of admission to yale the burlington high school principal wrote in a reference letter to the headmaster at lawrenceville that leopold was  as earnest a boy as we have in school painstaking in his work moral character above reproach  he arrived at his new school in january 1904 shortly before he turned seventeen he was considered an attentive student although he was again drawn to the outdoors lawrenceville was suitably rural and leopold spent much time mapping the area and studying its wildlife leopold studied at the lawrenceville school for a year during which time he was accepted to yale university because the yale school of forestry granted only graduate degrees he first enrolled in sheffield scientific school s preparatory forestry courses for his undergraduate studies while leopold was able to explore the woods and fields of lawrenceville daily sometimes to the detriment of his studying in yale he had little opportunity to do so  his studies and social life engagements made his outdoor trips few and far between

in 1924 he accepted transfer to the us forest products laboratory in madison wisconsin and became an associate director
in 1933 he was appointed professor of game management in the agricultural economics department at the university of wisconsin madison the first such professorship of wildlife management

ideas
early on leopold was assigned to hunt and kill bears wolves and mountain lions in new mexico local ranchers hated these predators because of livestock losses but leopold came to respect the animals he developed an ecological ethic that replaced the earlier wilderness ethic that stressed the need for human dominance rethinking the importance of predators in the balance of nature resulted in the return of bears and mountain lions to new mexico wilderness areas
by the early 1920s leopold had concluded that a particular kind of preservation should be embraced in the national forests of the american west he was prompted to this by the rampant building of roads to accommodate the  proliferation of the automobile  and the related increasingly heavy recreational demands placed on public lands he was the first to employ the term  wilderness  to describe such preservation over the next two decades he added ethical and scientific rationales to his defense of the wilderness concept in one essay he rhetorically asked  of what avail are forty freedoms without a blank spot on the map   leopold saw a progress of ethical sensitivity from interpersonal relationships to relationships to society as a whole to relationships with the land leading to a steady diminution of actions based on expediency conquest and self-interest leopold thus rejected the utilitarianism of conservationists such as gifford pinchot and theodore roosevelt
by the 1930s leopold was the nation s foremost expert on wildlife management he advocated the scientific management of wildlife habitats by both public and private landholders rather than a reliance on game refuges hunting laws and other methods intended to protect specific species of desired game in his 1933 book game management leopold defined the science of wildlife management as  the art of making land produce sustained annual crops of wild game for recreational use  but as curt meine has pointed out he also viewed it as a technique for restoring and maintaining diversity in the environment the concept of  wilderness  also took on a new meaning  he no longer saw it as a hunting or recreational ground but as an arena for a healthy biotic community including wolves and mountain lions in 1935 he helped found the wilderness society dedicated to expanding and protecting the nation s wilderness areas he regarded the society as  one of the focal points of a new attitude an intelligent humility toward man s place in nature  science writer connie barlow says leopold wrote eloquently from a perspective that today would be called religious naturalism 
nature writing
leopold s nature writing is notable for its simple directness his portrayals of various natural environments through which he had moved or had known for many years displayed impressive intimacy with what exists and happens in nature he offered frank criticism of the harm he believed was frequently done to natural systems  such as land  out of a sense of a culture or society s sovereign ownership over the land base   eclipsing any sense of a community of life to which humans belong he felt the security and prosperity resulting from  mechanization  now gives people the time to reflect on the preciousness of nature and to learn more about what happens there however he also wrote  theoretically the mechanization of farming ought to cut the farmer s chains but whether it really does is debatable 
a sand county almanac
the book was published in 1949 shortly after leopold s death one of the well-known quotes from the book which clarifies his land ethic is
the concept of a trophic cascade is put forth in the chapter  thinking like a mountain  wherein leopold realizes that killing a predator wolf carries serious implications for the rest of the ecosystem   a conclusion that found sympathetic appreciation generations later 
land ethic
in  the land ethic  a chapter in a sand county almanac leopold delves into conservation in  the ecological conscience  section he wrote   conservation is a state of harmony between men and land  he noted that conservation guidelines at the time boiled down to   obey the law vote right join some organizations and practice what conservation is profitable on your own land  the government will do the rest   p 243 244
