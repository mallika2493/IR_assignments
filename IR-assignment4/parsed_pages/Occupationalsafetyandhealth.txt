occupational safety and health - wikipedia
occupational safety and health  osh  also commonly referred to as occupational health and safety  ohs  occupational health or workplace health and safety  whs  is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the safety health and welfare of people at work these terms of course also refer to the goals of this field so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of occupational safety and health program department etc
the goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe and healthy work environment osh may also protect co-workers family members employers customers and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment in the united states the term occupational health and safety is referred to as occupational health and occupational and non-occupational safety and includes safety for activities outside of work
in common-law jurisdictions employers have a common law duty to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees statute law may in addition impose other general duties introduce specific duties and create government bodies with powers to regulate workplace safety issues  details of this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction
all organizations have the duty to ensure that employees and any other person who may be affected by the organization s activities remain safe at all times


definition
as defined by the world health organization  who   occupational health deals with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of hazards  health has been defined as  a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity  occupational health is a multidisciplinary field of healthcare concerned with enabling an individual to undertake their occupation in the way that causes least harm to their health health has been defined as it contrasts for example with the promotion of health and safety at work which is concerned with preventing harm from any incidental hazards arising in the workplace
since 1950 the international labour organization  ilo  and the world health organization  who  have shared a common definition of occupational health it was adopted by the joint ilo who committee on occupational health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995 the definition reads 
those in the field of occupational health come from a wide range of disciplines and professions including medicine psychology epidemiology physiotherapy and rehabilitation occupational therapy occupational medicine human factors and ergonomics and many others professionals advise on a broad range of occupational health matters these include how to avoid particular pre-existing conditions causing a problem in the occupation correct posture for the work frequency of rest breaks preventative action that can be undertaken and so forth
 occupational health should aim at  the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations  the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions  the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health  the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities  and to summarize the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job
history
the research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon as labor movements arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution worker s health entered consideration as a labor-related issue
in the united kingdom the factory acts of the early nineteenth century  from 1802 onwards  arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working in cotton mills  the act of 1833 created a dedicated professional factory inspectorate  41 the initial remit of the inspectorate was to police restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young persons  introduced to prevent chronic overwork identified as leading directly to ill-health and deformation and indirectly to a high accident rate  however on the urging of the factory inspectorate a further act in 1844 giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry introduced a requirement for machinery guarding  but only in the textile industry and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children   85
in 1840 a royal commission published its findings on the state of conditions for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of accidents the commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the mines act of 1842 the act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements and by 1850 inspectors were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion
otto von bismarck inaugurated the first social insurance legislation in 1883 and the first worker s compensation law in 1884   the first of their kind in the western world similar acts followed in other countries partly in response to labor unrest
workplace hazards
although work provides many economic and other benefits a wide array of workplace hazards also present risks to the health and safety of people at work these include but are not limited to  chemicals biological agents physical factors adverse ergonomic conditions allergens a complex network of safety risks  and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors personal protective equipment can help protect against many of these hazards
physical hazards affect many people in the workplace occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the united states with 22 million workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated  242 million spent annually on worker s compensation for hearing loss disability falls are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities especially in construction extraction transportation healthcare and building cleaning and maintenance machines have moving parts sharp edges hot surfaces and other hazards with the potential to crush burn cut shear stab or otherwise strike or wound workers if used unsafely
biological hazards  biohazards  include infectious microorganisms such as viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax biohazards affect workers in many industries  influenza for example affects a broad population of workers outdoor workers including farmers landscapers and construction workers risk exposure to numerous biohazards including animal bites and stings urushiol from poisonous plants and diseases transmitted through animals such as the west nile virus and lyme disease health care workers including veterinary health workers risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens and various infectious diseases especially those that are emerging
dangerous chemicals can pose a chemical hazard in the workplace there are many classifications of hazardous chemicals including neurotoxins immune agents dermatologic agents carcinogens reproductive toxins systemic toxins asthmagens pneumoconiotic agents and sensitizers authorities such as regulatory agencies set occupational exposure limits to mitigate the risk of chemical hazards an international effort is investigating the health effects of mixtures of chemicals there is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals this may be particularly important in causing cancer
psychosocial hazards include risks to the mental and emotional well-being of workers such as feelings of job insecurity long work hours and poor work-life balance a recent cochrane review - using moderate quality evidence - related that the addition of work-directed interventions for depressed workers receiving clinical interventions reduces the number of lost work days as compared to clinical interventions alone this review also demonstrated that the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to primary or occupational care and the addition of a  structured telephone outreach and care management program  to usual care are both effective at reducing sick leave days
by industry
specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry construction workers might be particularly at risk of falls for instance whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of drowning the united states bureau of labor statistics identifies the fishing aviation lumber metalworking agriculture mining and transportation industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers similarly psychosocial risks such as workplace violence are more pronounced for certain occupational groups such as health care employees police correctional officers and teachers
construction
construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the united states and in the european union in 2009 the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the united states was nearly three times that for all workers falls are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations it is of utmost importance to ensure health and safety of workers and compliance with hse construction requirements health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations for example the role of the construction design management  cdm  coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site
the 2010 national health interview survey occupational health supplement  nhis-ohs  identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and chemical physical exposures which may increase some health risks among all us workers in the construction sector 44  had non-standard work arrangements  were not regular permanent employees  compared to 19  of all us workers 15  had temporary employment compared to 7  of all us workers and 55  experienced job insecurity compared to 32  of all us workers prevalence rates for exposure to physical chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector among nonsmoking workers 24  of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10  of all us workers were exposed other physical chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction industry were frequently working outdoors  73   and frequent exposure to vapors gas dust or fumes  51  
agriculture
agriculture workers are often at risk of work-related injuries lung disease noise-induced hearing loss skin disease as well as certain cancers related to chemical use or prolonged sun exposure on industrialized farms injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery the most common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in the united states is tractor rollovers which can be prevented by the use of roll over protection structures which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects as an industry in which families including children commonly work alongside their families agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among younger workers common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents
the 2010 nhis-ohs found elevated prevalence rates of several occupational exposures in the agriculture forestry and fishing sector which may negatively impact health these workers often worked long hours the prevalence rate of working more than 48 hours a week among workers employed in these industries was 37  and 24  worked more than 60 hours a week of all workers in these industries 85  frequently worked outdoors compared to 25  of all us workers additionally 53  were frequently exposed to vapors gas dust or fumes compared to 25  of all us workers
service sector
as the number of service sector jobs has risen in developed countries more and more jobs have become sedentary presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with manufacturing and the primary sector contemporary problems such as the growing rate of obesity and issues relating to occupational stress workplace bullying and overwork in many countries have further complicated the interaction between work and health
according to data from the 2010 nhis-ohs hazardous physical chemical exposures in the service sector were lower than national averages on the other hand potentially harmful work organization characteristics and psychosocial workplace exposures were relatively common in this sector among all workers in the service industry 30  experienced job insecurity in 2010 27  worked non-standard shifts  not a regular day shift  21  had non-standard work arrangements  were not regular permanent employees 
mining and oil   gas extraction
according to data from the 2010 nhis-ohs workers employed in mining and oil   gas extraction industries had high prevalence rates of exposure to potentially harmful work organization characteristics and hazardous chemicals many of these workers worked long hours  50  worked more than 48 hours a week and 25  worked more than 60 hours a week in 2010 additionally 42  worked non-standard shifts  not a regular day shift  these workers also had high prevalence of exposure to physical chemical hazards in 2010 39  had frequent skin contact with chemicals among nonsmoking workers 28  of those in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had frequent exposure to secondhand smoke at work about two-thirds were frequently exposed to vapors gas dust or fumes at work
healthcare and social assistance
healthcare workers are exposed to many hazards that can adversely affect their health and well-being long hours changing shifts physically demanding tasks violence and exposures to infectious diseases and harmful chemicals are examples of hazards that put these workers at risk for illness and injury
according to the bureau of labor statistics us hospitals recorded 253,700 work-related injuries and illnesses in 2011 which is 6.8 work-related injuries and illnesses for every 100 full-time employees the injury and illness rate in hospitals is higher than the rates in construction and manufacturing   two industries that are traditionally thought to be relatively hazardous
the occupational health safety network  ohsn  is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the national institute for occupational safety and health  niosh  to address health and safety risks among health care personnel ohsn uses existing data to characterize risk of injury and illness among health care workers hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities niosh works with ohsn participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions ohsn modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel  musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities  slips trips and falls  and workplace violence ohsn enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities
workplace fatality and injury statistics
united states
the bureau of labor statistics of the united states department of labor compiles information about workplace fatalities and non-fatal injuries in the united states in 1970 an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job   by 2010 the workforce had doubled but workplace deaths were down to about 4,500
between 1913 and 2013 workplace fatalities dropped by approximately 80 
the bureau also compiles information about the most dangerous jobs according to the census of occupational injuries 4,679 people died on the job in 2014
musculoskeletal injuries accounted for 32  of all employer-reported injuries and illnesses in 2014
european union
in most countries males comprise the vast majority of workplace fatalities in the eu as a whole 94  of death were of males in the uk the disparity was even greater with males comprising 97.4  of workplace deaths in the uk there were 171 fatal injuries at work in financial year 2011-2 compared with 651 in calendar year 1974  the fatal injury rate declined over that period from 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 workers to 0.6 per 100,000 workers
management systems
international
in 2001 the international labor organization  ilo  published ilo-osh 2001 also titled  guidelines a on occupational safety and health management systems  to assist organizations with introducing osh management systems these guidelines encourage continual improvement in employee health and safety achieved via a constant process of policy organization planning   implementation evaluation and action for improvement all supported by constant auditing to determine the success of osh actions
the ilo management system was created to assist employers to keep pace with rapidly shifting and competitive industrial environments the ilo recognizes that national legislation is essential but sometimes insufficient on its own to address the challenges faced by industry and therefore elected to ensure free and open distribution of administrative tools in the form of occupational health and safety management system guidance for everyone this open access forum is intended to provide the tools for industry to create safe and healthy working environments and foster positive safety cultures within the organizations
ohsas 18000 is an international occupational health and safety management system specification developed by the london-based bsi group a multinational business chiefly concerned with the production and distribution of standards related services ohsas 18000 comprises two parts ohsas 18001 and 18002 and embraces a number of other publications ohsas 18000 is the internationally recognized assessment specification for occupational health and safety management systems it was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard exists this internationally recognized specification for occupational health and safety management system operates on the basis of policy planning implementation and operation checking and corrective action management review and continual improvement
the british standards   occupational health and safety management systems requirements standard bs ohsas 18001 was developed within the framework of the iso standards series allowing it to integrate better into the larger system of iso certifications iso 9001 quality management systems and iso 14001 environmental management system can work in tandem with bs ohsas 18001 18002 to complement each other and form a better overall system each component of the system is specific auditable and accreditable by a third party after review
also standards australia and the association fran aise de normalisation  afnor  in france have developed occupational safety and health management standards
united kingdom
guidance note hsg65  successful health and safety management published by the british non-departmental public body health and safety executive was substantially re-written 2013 it now promotes the plan do check act approach to health and safety management sharing similarities with bs ohsas 18001 this achieved a balance between the original systems-based approach and the more modern behavioural approach to safety management
national legislation and public organizations
occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different approaches to legislation regulation enforcement and incentives for compliance in the eu for example some member states promote osh by providing public monies as subsidies grants or financing while others have created tax system incentives for osh investments a third group of eu member states has experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for companies or organisations with strong osh records
australia
in australia the commonwealth four of the six states and both territories have enacted and administer harmonised work health and safety legislation in accordance with the intergovernmental agreement for regulatory and operational reform in occupational health and safety each of these jurisdictions has enacted work health   safety legislation and regulations based on the commonwealth work health and safety act 2011 and common codes of practice developed by safe work australia some jurisdictions have also included mine safety under the model approach however most have retained separate legislation for the time being western australia intends to adopt a moderated version of the model approach and victoria has retained its own regime although the model whs laws themselves drew heavily on the victoria approach
canada
in canada workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work workers covered by federal legislation  including those in mining transportation and federal employment  are covered by the canada labour code  all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work the canadian centre for occupational health and safety  ccohs  an agency of the government of canada was created in 1966 by an act of parliament the act was based on the belief that all canadians had  a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment  ccohs is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses the ccohs maintains a useful  partial  list of osh regulations for canada and its provinces
european union
in the european union member states have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met in many eu countries there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations  eg unions  to ensure good osh performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker  through maintenance of health  and the enterprise  through improved productivity and quality  in 1996 the european agency for safety and health at work was founded
member states of the european union have all transposed into their national legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on occupational health and safety these directives  of which there are about 20 on a variety of topics  follow a similar structure requiring the employer to assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a hierarchy of control this hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and ends with personal protective equipment
however certain eu member states admit to having lacking quality control in occupational safety services to situations in which risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain eu osh directives based on this it is hardly surprising that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6  to 3.8  of gnp between the eu member states
in denmark occupational safety and health is regulated by the danish act on working environment and cooperation at the workplace the danish working environment authority carries out inspections of companies draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work the result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the danish working environment authority so that the general public current and prospective employees customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection should they wish to do so
in spain occupational safety and health is regulated by the spanish act on prevention of labour risks the ministry of employment and social security is the authority responsible for issues relating to labour environment the national institute for labour safety and hygiene is the technical public organization specialized in occupational safety and health
in sweden occupational safety and health is regulated by the work environment act the swedish work environment authority is the government agency responsible for issues relating to the working environment the agency should work to disseminate information and furnish advice on osh has a mandate to carry out inspections and a right to issue stipulations and injunctions to any non-compliant employer
in the uk health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the health and safety executive and local authorities  the local council  under the health and safety at work etc act 1974  hasawa  hasawa introduced  section 2  a general duty on an employer to ensure so far as is reasonably practicable the health safety and welfare at work of all his employees  with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting  codes of practice  not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable  deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment  the previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated hse has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties  where something must be done with no  reasonable practicability  test  but in the uk the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules and towards  goal setting  and risk assessment recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment the other key aspect of the uk legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees this followed a similar approach in scandinavia and that approach has since been adopted in australia canada new zealand and malaysia for example
for the uk the government organisation dealing with occupational health has been the employment medical advisory service but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation - the health and work service - was created to provide advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on long-term sick-leave the service funded by government will offer medical assessments and treatment plans on a voluntary basis to people on long term absence from their employer  in return the government will no longer foot the bill for statutory sick pay provided by the employer to the individual
india
in india the labour ministry formulates national policies on occupational safety and health in factories and docks with advice and assistance from directorate general of factory advice service and labour institutes  dgfasli  and enforces its policies through inspectorates of factories and inspectorates of dock safety dgfasli is the technical arm of the ministry of labour   employment government of india and advises the factories on various problems concerning safety health efficiency and well - being of the persons at work places the dgfasli provides technical support in formulating rules conducting occupational safety surveys and also for conducting occupational safety training programs
malaysia
in malaysia the department of occupational safety and health  dosh  under the ministry of human resource is responsible to ensure that the safety health and welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld dosh is responsible to enforce the factories and machinery act 1967 and the occupational safety and health act 1994
people s republic of china
in the people s republic of china the ministry of health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the state administration of work safety for safety issues at work on the provincial and municipal level there are health supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of work safety for safety the  occupational disease control act of prc  came into force on may 1 2002 and work safety act of prc on november 1 2002 the occupational disease control act is under revision the prevention of occupational disease is still in its initial stage compared with industrialised countries such as the us or uk
singapore
in singapore the ministry of manpower operates various checks and campaigns against unsafe work practices such as when working at height operating cranes and in traffic management examples include operation cormorant and the falls prevention campaign
south africa
in south africa the department of labour is responsible for occupational health and safety inspection and enforcement in commerce and industry apart from mining and energy production where the department of mineral resources is responsible
the main statutory legislation on health and safety in the jurisdiction of the department of labour is act no 85 of 1993  occupational health and safety act as amended by occupational health and safety amendment act no 181 of 1993
regulations to the ohs act include 
taiwan
in taiwan the occupational safety and health administration of the ministry of labor is in charge of occupational safety and health the matter is governed under the occupational safety and health act
2007official release the document toshms  taiwan occupational safety and health management system which defined the basic rule about occupational safety standard
united states
in the united states president richard nixon signed the occupational safety and health act into law on december 29 1970 the act created the three agencies that administer it they include the occupational safety and health administration national institute for occupational safety and health and the occupational safety and health review commission the act authorized the occupational safety and health administration  osha  to regulate private employers in the 50 states the district of columbia and territories the act establishing it includes a general duty clause  29 usc   654 5 a   requiring an employer to comply with the act and regulations derived from it and to provide employees with  employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees 
osha was established in 1971 under the department of labor it has headquarters in washington dc and ten regional offices further broken down into districts each organized into three sections  compliance training and assistance its stated mission is to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training outreach education and assistance the original plan was for osha to oversee 50 state plans with osha funding 50  of each plan unfortunately it has not worked out that way there are currently 26 approved state plans  4 cover only public employees  and no other states want to participate osha manages the plan in the states not participating
osha develops safety standards in the code of federal regulation and enforces those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by compliance officers  enforcement resources are focussed on high-hazard industries worksites may apply to enter osha s voluntary protection program  vpp   a successful application leads to an on-site inspection   if this is passed the site gains vpp status and osha no longer inspect it annually nor  normally  visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until vpp revalidation  after 3 5 years  vpp sites have injury and illness rates less than half the average for their industry 
it has 73 specialists in local offices to provide tailored information and training to employers and employees at little or no cost similarly osha produces a range of publications provides advice to employers and funds consultation services available for small businesses
osha s alliance program enables groups committed to worker safety and health to work with it to develop compliance assistance tools and resources share information with workers and employers and educate them about their rights and responsibilities osha also has a strategic partnership program that zeros in on specific hazards or specific geographic areas osha manages susan b harwood grants to nonprofit companies to train workers and employers to recognize avoid and prevent safety and health hazards in the workplace grants focus on small business hard-to-reach workers and high-hazard industries
the national institute of occupational safety and health  niosh  created under the same act works closely with osha and provides the research behind many of osha s regulations and standards
professional roles and responsibilities
the roles and responsibilities of osh professionals vary regionally but may include evaluating working environments developing endorsing and encouraging measures that might prevent injuries and illnesses providing osh information to employers employees and the public providing medical examinations and assessing the success of worker health programs
europe
in norway the main required tasks of an occupational health and safety practitioner include the following 
in the netherlands the required tasks for health and safety staff are only summarily defined and include the following 
 the main influence of the dutch law on the job of the safety professional is through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified working conditions service to advise them on health and safety  a  certified service  must employ sufficient numbers of four types of certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the service 
in 2004 37  of health and safety practitioners in norway and 14  in the netherlands had an msc  44  had a bsc in norway and 63  in the netherlands  and 19  had training as an osh technician in norway and 23  in the netherlands
usa
the main tasks undertaken by the ohs practitioner in the usa include 
knowledge required by the ohs professional in usa include 
some skills required by the ohs professional in the usa include  but are not limited to  
differences between countries and regions
because different countries take different approaches to ensuring occupational safety and health areas of osh need and focus also vary between countries and regions similar to the findings of the enhspo survey conducted in australia the institute of occupational medicine in the uk found that there is a need to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the uk in contrast in australia and the usa a major responsibility of the ohs professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation however in some other areas of europe it is precisely this which has been lacking   nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities 
identifying safety and health hazards
hazards risks outcomes
the terminology used in osh varies between countries but generally speaking 
 hazard   risk  and  outcome  are used in other fields to describe eg environmental damage or damage to equipment however in the context of osh  harm  generally describes the direct or indirect degradation temporary or permanent of the physical mental or social well-being of workers for example repetitively carrying out manual handling of heavy objects is a hazard the outcome could be a musculoskeletal disorder  msd  or an acute back or joint injury the risk can be expressed numerically  eg a 0.5 or 50 50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year  in relative terms  eg  high medium low   or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme  eg situation-specific risks 
hazard identification
hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process it is where individual work hazards are identified assessed and controlled eliminated as close to source  location of the hazard  as reasonably as possible as technology resources social expectation or regulatory requirements change hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are  acceptable risks  in the workplace a hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks but neither does it accept  satisfactory    but still risky   outcomes and as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group workers a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach
the information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from as mentioned previously examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard history and analysis of past incidents and official reports of work and the hazards encountered of these the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices events releases hazards and other relevant information once the information is gathered from a collection of sources it is recommended for these to be digitally archived  to allow for quick searching  and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible one innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format
risk assessment
modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a risk assessment be carried out prior to making an intervention it should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical
this assessment should 
the calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or probability of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences this can be expressed mathematically as a quantitative assessment  by assigning low medium and high likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a risk factor  or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the harm could arise
the assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices the assessment should include practical recommendations to control the risk once recommended controls are implemented the risk should be re-calculated to determine of it has been lowered to an acceptable level generally speaking newly introduced controls should lower risk by one level ie from high to medium or from medium to low
contemporary developments
on an international scale the world health organization  who  and the international labour organization  ilo  have begun focusing on labour environments in developing nations with projects such as healthy cities many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in osh leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents as a 2007 factsheet from the european agency for safety and health at work states   countries with less developed osh systems spend a far higher percentage of gdp on work-related injury and illness   taking resources away from more productive activities    the ilo estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10  of gdp in latin america compared with just 2.6  to 3.8  in the eu  there is continued use of asbestos a notorious hazard in some developing countries so asbestos-related disease is sadly expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future
nanotechnology
nanotechnology is an example of a new relatively unstudied technology a swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter nanotechnology already presents new issues for osh professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex the size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective the toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter as nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance this presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage
education
