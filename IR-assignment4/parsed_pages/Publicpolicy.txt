government actions and process of public policy making
public policy making can be characterized as a dynamic complex and interactive system through which public problems are identified and countered by creating new public policy or by reforming existing public policy  public problems can originate in endless ways and require different policy responses  such as regulations subsidies quotas and laws  on the local national or international level
public policy making is a continuous process that has many feedback loops verification and evaluation are essential to the functioning of this system the public problems that influence public policy making can be of economic social or political nature each system is influenced by different public problems and thus requires different public policy
in public policy making numerous individuals and interest groups compete and collaborate to influence policymakers to act in a particular way the large set of actors in the public policy process such as politicians civil servants lobbyists domain experts and industry representatives use a variety of tactics and tools to advance their aims including advocating their positions publicly attempting to educate supporters and opponents and mobilizing allies on a particular issue many actors can be important in the public policy process but government officials ultimately choose public policy in response to the public issue or problem at hand in doing so government officials are expected to meet public sector ethics and take the needs of all stakeholders into account
since societies have changed in the past decades the public policy making system changed too today public policy making is increasingly goal-oriented aiming for measurable results and goals and decision-centric focusing on decisions that must be taken immediately furthermore mass communications and technological changes have caused the public policy system to become more complex and interconnected the changes pose new challenges to the current public policy systems and pressure them to evolve in order to remain effective and efficient
academic discipline
as an academic discipline public policy brings in elements of many social science fields and concepts including economics sociology political economy program evaluation policy analysis and public management all as applied to problems of governmental administration management and operations at the same time the study of public policy is distinct from political science or economics in its focus on the application of theory to practice while the majority of public policy degrees are master s and doctoral degrees there are several universities also offer undergraduate education in public policy
traditionally the academic field of public policy focused on domestic policy however the wave of economic globalization which occurred in the late 20th and early 21st centuries created a need for a subset of public policy that focuses on global governance especially as it relates to issues that transcend national borders such as climate change terrorism nuclear proliferation and economic development consequently many traditional public policy schools had to tweak their curricula to adjust to this new policy landscape as well as developed whole new ones
