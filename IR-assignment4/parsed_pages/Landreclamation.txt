land reclamation - wikipedia
land reclamation usually known as reclamation and also known as land fill  not to be confused with a landfill  is the process of creating new land from ocean riverbeds or lake beds the land reclaimed is known as reclamation ground or land fill
in a number of other jurisdictions including parts of the united states the term  reclamation  can refer to returning disturbed lands to an improved state in alberta canada for example reclamation is defined by the provincial government as  the process of reconverting disturbed land to its former or other productive uses  in oceania it is frequently referred to as land rehabilitation


methods
land reclamation can be achieved with a number of different methods the most simple method involves simply filling the area with large amounts of heavy rock and or cement then filling with clay and dirt until the desired height is reached the process is called  infilling  and the material used to fill the space is generically called  infill  draining of submerged wetlands is often used to reclaim land for agricultural use deep cement mixing is used typically in situations in which the material displaced by either dredging or draining may be contaminated and hence needs to be contained
habitation
the creation of new land was for the need of human activities
notable examples include 
asia
europe
africa
americas
one of the earliest large scale projects was the beemster polder in the netherlands realized in 1612 adding 70 square kilometres  27 sq mi  of land in hong kong the praya reclamation scheme added 20 to 24 hectares  50 to 60 acres  of land in 1890 during the second phase of construction it was one of the most ambitious projects ever taken during the colonial hong kong era some 20  of land in the tokyo bay area has been reclaimed most notably odaiba artificial island le portier monaco and gibraltar are also expanding due to land reclamation the city of rio de janeiro was largely built on reclaimed land as was wellington new zealand
artificial islands are an example of land reclamation creating an artificial island is an expensive and risky undertaking it is often considered in places with high population density and a scarcity of flat land kansai international airport  in osaka  and hong kong international airport are examples where this process was deemed necessary the palm islands the world and hotel burj al-arab off dubai in the united arab emirates are other examples of artificial islands  although there is yet no real  scarcity of land  in dubai  as well as the flevopolder in the netherlands which is the largest artificial island in the world
agriculture
agriculture was a drive for land reclamation before industrialisation in south china farmers reclaimed paddy fields by enclosing an area with a stone wall on the sea shore near a river mouth or river delta the species of rice that grow on these grounds are more salt tolerant another use of such enclosed land is the creation of fish ponds it is commonly seen on the pearl river delta and hong kong these reclaimed areas also attract species of migrating birds
a related practice is the draining of swampy or seasonally submerged wetlands to convert them to farmland while this does not create new land exactly it allows commercially productive use of land that would otherwise be restricted to wildlife habitat it is also an important method of mosquito control
even in the post-industrial age there have been land reclamation projects intended for increasing available agricultural land for example the village of ogata in akita japan was established on land reclaimed from lake hachirogata  japan s second largest lake at the time  starting in 1957 by 1977 the amount of land reclaimed totalled 172.03 square kilometres  66.42 sq mi 
beach restoration
beach rebuilding is the process of repairing beaches using materials such as sand or mud from inland this can be used to build up beaches suffering from beach starvation or erosion from longshore drift it stops the movement of the original beach material through longshore drift and retains a natural look to the beach although it is not a long-lasting solution it is cheap compared to other types of coastal defences
landfill
as human overcrowding of developed areas intensified during the 20th century it has become important to develop land re-use strategies for completed landfills some of the most common usages are for parks golf courses and other sports fields increasingly however office buildings and industrial uses are made on a completed landfill in these latter uses methane capture is customarily carried out to minimize explosive hazard within the building
an example of a class a office building constructed over a landfill is the dakin building at sierra point brisbane california the underlying fill was deposited from 1965 to 1985 mostly consisting of construction debris from san francisco and some municipal wastes aerial photographs prior to 1965 show this area to be tidelands of the san francisco bay a clay cap was constructed over the debris prior to building approval
a notable example is sydney olympic park the primary venue for the 2000 summer olympic games which was built atop an industrial wasteland that included landfills
another strategy for landfill is the incineration of landfill trash at high temperature via the plasma-arc gasification process which is currently used at two facilities in japan and will be used at a planned facility in st lucie county florida
environmental impact
draining wetlands for ploughing for example is a form of habitat destruction in some parts of the world new reclamation projects are restricted or no longer allowed due to environmental protection laws
environmental legislation
the state of california created a state commission the san francisco bay conservation and development commission in 1965 to protect san francisco bay and regulate development near its shores the commission was created in response to growing concern over the shrinking size of the bay
hong kong legislators passed the protection of the harbour ordinance proposed by the society for protection of the harbour in 1997 in an effort to safeguard the increasingly threatened victoria harbour against encroaching land development several large reclamation schemes at green island west kowloon and kowloon bay were subsequently shelved and others reduced in size
dangers
reclaimed land is highly susceptible to soil liquefaction during earthquakes which can amplify the amount of damage that occurs to buildings and infrastructure subsidence is another issue both from soil compaction on filled land and also when wetlands are enclosed by levees and drained to create polders drained marshes will eventually sink below the surrounding water level increasing the danger from flooding
