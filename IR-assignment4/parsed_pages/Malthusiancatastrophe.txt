malthusian catastrophe - wikipedia
a malthusian catastrophe  also known as malthusian check  is a prediction of a forced return to subsistence-level conditions once population growth has outpaced agricultural production


thomas malthus
in 1779 thomas malthus wrote 
notwithstanding the apocalyptic image conveyed by this particular paragraph malthus himself did not subscribe to the notion that mankind was fated for a  catastrophe  due to population overshooting resources rather he believed that population growth was generally restricted by available resources 
neo-malthusian theory
after world war ii mechanized agriculture produced a dramatic increase in productivity of agriculture and the green revolution greatly increased crop yields expanding the world s food supply while lowering food prices in response the growth rate of the world s population accelerated rapidly resulting in predictions by paul r ehrlich simon hopkins and many others of an imminent malthusian catastrophe however populations of most developed countries grew slowly enough to be outpaced by gains in productivity
by the early 21st century many technologically developed countries had passed through the demographic transition a complex social development encompassing a drop in total fertility rates in response to various fertility factors including lower infant mortality increased urbanization and a wider availability of effective birth control
on the assumption that the demographic transition is now spreading from the developed countries to less developed countries the united nations population fund estimates that human population may peak in the late 21st century rather than continue to grow until it has exhausted available resources
historians have estimated the total human population back to 10,000 bc the figure on the right shows the trend of total population from 1800 to 2005 and from there in three projections out to 2100  low medium and high  the united nations population projections out to 2100  the red orange and green lines  show a possible peak in the world s population occurring by 2040 in the first scenario and by 2100 in the second scenario and never ending growth in the third
the graph of annual growth rates  at the top of the page  does not appear exactly as one would expect for long-term exponential growth for exponential growth it should be a straight line at constant height whereas in fact the graph from 1800 to 2005 is dominated by an enormous hump that began about 1920 peaked in the mid-1960s and has been steadily eroding away for the last 40 years the sharp fluctuation between 1959 and 1960 was due to the combined effects of the great leap forward and a natural disaster in china also visible on this graph are the effects of the great depression the two world wars and possibly also the 1918 flu pandemic
though short-term trends even on the scale of decades or centuries cannot prove or disprove the existence of mechanisms promoting a malthusian catastrophe over longer periods the prosperity of a major fraction of the human population at the beginning of the 21st century and the debatability of ecological collapse made by paul r ehrlich in the 1960s and 1970s has led some people such as economist julian l simon to question its inevitability
a 2004 study by a group of prominent economists and ecologists including kenneth arrow and paul ehrlich suggests that the central concerns regarding sustainability have shifted from population growth to the consumption savings ratio due to shifts in population growth rates since the 1970s empirical estimates show that public policy  taxes or the establishment of more complete property rights  can promote more efficient consumption and investment that are sustainable in an ecological sense  that is given the current  relatively low  population growth rate the malthusian catastrophe can be avoided by either a shift in consumer preferences or public policy that induces a similar shift
a 2002 study by the un food and agriculture organization predicts that world food production will be in excess of the needs of the human population by the year 2030  however that source also states that hundreds of millions will remain hungry  presumably due to economic realities and political issues 
criticism
since the mid-19th century many economists have suggested that humanity will not face a malthusian catastrophe because  necessity is the mother of invention  and  the market will fix itself 
karl marx and friedrich engels argued that malthus failed to recognize a crucial difference between humans and other species in capitalist societies as engels put it scientific and technological  progress is as unlimited and at least as rapid as that of population  marx argued even more broadly that the growth of both a human population in toto and the  relative surplus population  within it occurred in direct proportion to accumulation
henry george criticized malthus s view that population growth was a cause of poverty arguing that poverty was caused by human greed george also argued that if population growth were a cause of hardship it would not be promoted by all religions
ester boserup suggested that population levels determined agricultural methods rather than agricultural methods determining population
julian simon was another economist who argued that there could be no global malthusian catastrophe because of two factors   1  the existence of new knowledge and educated people to take advantage of it and  2   economic freedom  that is the ability of the world to increase production when there is a profitable opportunity to do so
joseph tainter argues that science has diminishing marginal returns and scientific progress is becoming more difficult harder to achieve and more costly
