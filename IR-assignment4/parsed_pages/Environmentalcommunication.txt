academic field
as an academic field environmental communication emerged from interdisciplinary work involving communication environmental studies environmental science risk analysis and management sociology and political ecology
flor  2004  considers it as a significant element in the environmental sciences which he believes to be a transdicipline he begins his textbook on environmental communication with a declarative statement  environmentalism as we know it today began with environmental communication the environmental movement was ignited by a spark from a writer s pen or more specifically and accurately rachel carson s typewriter  according to flor environmental communication has six essentials  knowledge of ecological laws  sensitivity to the cultural dimension  ability to network effectively  efficiency in using media for social agenda setting  appreciation and practice of environmental ethics  and conflict resolution mediation and arbitration  ibid  in an earlier book flor and gomez  1993  explore the development of an environmental communication curriculum from the perspectives of practitioners from the government the private sector and the academe
climate change communications has historically focused on news coverage and disseminating information academic fields such as psychology environmental sociology and risk communication have argued that public nonresponse to climate change is due to a lack of information in her book living in denial  climate change emotions and everyday life norgaard s  2011  study of bygdaby  a fictional name used for a real city in norway  found that non-response was much more complex than just a lack of information in fact too much information can do the exact opposite because people tend to neglect global warming once they realize there is no easy solution when people understand the complexity of the issue they can feel overwhelmed and helpless which can lead to apathy or skepticism environmental skepticism is an increasing challenge for environmental rhetoric
symbolic action
environmental communication is also a type of symbolic action that serves two functions those functions are pragmatic and constitutive environmental communication is pragmatic because it helps individuals and organizations to accomplish goals and literally do things through communication examples of this include educating alerting persuading and collaborating environmental communication is constitutive because it helps to shape people s understandings of environmental issues themselves and nature  it shapes the meanings we hold of these things examples of this include values attitudes and ideologies vis- -vis nature and environmental issues and problems
communication theory has one universal law written by s f scudder in the early 1900s and later published in 1980 the universal communication law states that  all living entities beings and creatures communicate  in an unpublished interview scudder clarified the concept -  all of the living communicate through movements sounds reactions physical changes gestures languages breath color transformations etc communication is a means of survival existence and being and does not need another to acknowledge its presence examples - the cry of a child  communication that it is hungry hurt cold etc   the browning of a leaf  communication that it is dehydrated thirsty per se dying   the cry of an animal  communicating that it is injured hungry angry etc  everything living communicates 
scudder s thesis is aptly reinforced by general systems theory which submits that one of the three critical functions of living systems is the exchange of information with its environment and with other living systems  the other two being the exchange of materials and the exchange of energy  in his book flor  2004 page 4  extends this argument by forwarding that  all living systems from the simplest to the most complex are equipped to perform these critical functions they are called critical because they are necessary for the survival of the living system communication is nothing more than the exchange of information hence at its broadest sense environmental communication is necessary for the survival of every living system be it an organism an ecosystem or  even  a social system
