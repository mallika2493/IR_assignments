the population bomb - wikipedia
the population bomb is a best-selling book written by stanford university professor paul r ehrlich and his wife anne ehrlich  who was uncredited  in 1968 it warned of the mass starvation of humans in the 1970s and 1980s due to overpopulation as well as other major societal upheavals and advocated immediate action to limit population growth fears of a  population explosion  were widespread in the 1950s and 1960s but the book and its author brought the idea to an even wider audience the book has been criticized since its publishing for its alarmist tone and in recent decades for its inaccurate predictions the ehrlichs stand by the basic ideas in the book stating in 2009 that  perhaps the most serious flaw in the bomb was that it was much too optimistic about the future  and believe that it achieved their goals because  it alerted people to the importance of environmental issues and brought human numbers into the debate on the human future 


general description of the book
the population bomb was written at the suggestion of david brower the executive director of the environmentalist sierra club and ian ballantine of ballantine books following various public appearances ehrlich had made regarding population issues and their relation to the environment although the ehrlichs collaborated on the book the publisher insisted that a single author be credited and also asked to change their preferred title  population resources and environment the title population bomb was taken  with permission  from general william h draper founder of the population crisis committee and a pamphlet issued in 1954 by the hugh moore fund the ehrlichs regret the choice of title which they admit was a perfect choice from a marketing perspective but think that  it led paul to be miscategorized as solely focused on human numbers despite our interest in all the factors affecting the human trajectory 
early editions of the population bomb began with the statement 
much of the book is spent describing the state of the environment and the food security situation which is described as increasingly dire ehrlich argues that as the existing population was not being fed adequately and as it was growing rapidly it was unreasonable to expect sufficient improvements in food production to feed everyone he further argued that the growing population placed escalating strains on all aspects of the natural world
in answer to the question  what needs to be done   he wrote  we must rapidly bring the world population under control reducing the growth rate to zero or making it negative conscious regulation of human numbers must be achieved simultaneously we must at least temporarily greatly increase our food production  ehrlich described a number of  ideas on how these goals might be reached  he believed that the united states should take a leading role in population control both because it was already consuming much more than the rest of the world and therefore had a moral duty to reduce its impact and because the us would have to lead international efforts due to its prominence in the world in order to avoid charges of hypocrisy or racism it would have to take the lead in population reduction efforts ehrlich floats the idea of adding  temporary sterilants  to the water supply or staple foods however he rejects the idea as unpractical due to  criminal inadequacy of biomedical research in this area  he suggests a tax scheme in which additional children would add to a family s tax burden at increasing rates for more children as well as luxury taxes on childcare goods he suggests incentives for men who agree to permanent sterilization before they have two children as well as a variety of other monetary incentives he proposes a powerful department of population and environment which  should be set up with the power to take whatever steps are necessary to establish a reasonable population size in the united states and to put an end to the steady deterioration of our environment  the department should support research into population control such as better contraceptives mass sterilizing agents and prenatal sex discernment  because families often continue to have children until a male is born ehrlich suggested that if they could choose a male child this would reduce the birthrate  legislation should be enacted guaranteeing the right to an abortion and sex education should be expanded
after explaining the domestic policies the us should pursue he discusses foreign policy he advocates a system of  triage  such as that suggested by william and paul paddock in famine 1975  under this system countries would be divided into categories based on their abilities to feed themselves going forward countries with sufficient programmes in place to limit population growth and the ability to become self-sufficient in the future would continue to receive food aid countries for example india which were  so far behind in the population-food game that there is no hope that our food aid will see them through to self-sufficiency  would have their food aid eliminated ehrlich argued that this was the only realistic strategy in the long-term ehrlich applauds the paddocks   courage and foresight  in proposing such a solution ehrlich further discusses the need to set up public education programs and agricultural development schemes in developing countries he argues that the scheme would likely have to be implemented outside the framework of the united nations due to the necessity of being selective regarding the targeted regions and countries and suggests that within countries certain regions should be prioritized to the extent that cooperative separatist movements should be encouraged if they are an improvement over the existing authority he mentions his support for government mandated sterilization of indian males with three or more children
in the rest of the book ehrlich discusses things which readers can do to help this is focused primarily on changing public opinion to create pressure on politicians to enact the policies he suggests which he believed were not politically possible in 1968 at the end of the book he discusses the possibility that his forecasts may be wrong a fact which he felt he must acknowledge as a scientist however he believes that humanity will only be better off if it follows his prescriptions so that even if he is incorrect it is the right course of action
the book sold over two million copies raised the general awareness of population and environmental issues and influenced 1960s and 1970s public policy
context
in 1948 two widely read books were published that would inspire a  neo-malthusian  debate on population and the environment  fairfield osborn s our plundered planet and william vogt s road to survival although they are now much less well known than population bomb they inspired many works such as the original population bomb pamphlet by hugh everett moore in 1954 that inspired the name of ehrlich s book as well as some of the original societies concerned with population and environmental matters db luten has said that although the book is often seen as a seminal work in the field the population bomb is actually best understood as  climaxing and in a sense terminating the debate of the 1950s and 1960s  ehrlich has said that he traced his own malthusian beliefs to a lecture he heard vogt give when he was attending university in the early 1950s for ehrlich these writers provided  a global framework for things he had observed as a young naturalist 
criticisms
restatement of malthusian theory
the population bomb has been characterized by critics as primarily a repetition of the malthusian catastrophe argument that population growth will outpace agricultural growth unless controlled ehrlich observed that since about 1930 the population of the world had doubled within a single generation from 2 billion to nearly 4 billion and was on track to do so again he assumed that available resources on the other hand and in particular food were nearly at their limits some critics compare ehrlich unfavorably to malthus saying that although thomas malthus did not make a firm prediction of imminent catastrophe ehrlich warned of a potential massive disaster within the next decade or two in addition critics state that unlike malthus ehrlich did not see any means of avoiding the disaster entirely  although some mitigation was possible  and proposed solutions that were much more radical than those discussed by malthus such as starving whole countries that refused to implement population control measures
ehrlich was certainly not unique in his neo-malthusian predictions and there was a widespread belief in the 1960s and 70s that increasingly catastrophic famines were on their way
predictions
the ehrlichs made a number of specific predictions that did not come to pass for which they have received criticism they have acknowledged that some predictions were incorrect however they maintain that their general argument remains intact that their predictions were merely illustrative that their and others  warnings caused preventive action or that many of their predictions may yet come true  see ehrlich s response below  still other commentators have criticized the ehrlichs  perceived inability to acknowledge mistakes evasiveness and refusal to alter their arguments in the face of contrary evidence in 2015 ehrlich told retro report  i do not think my language was too apocalyptic in  the population bomb  my language would be even more apocalyptic today 
in the population bomb s opening lines the authors state that nothing can prevent famines in which hundreds of millions of people will die during the 1970s  amended to 1970s and 80s in later editions  and that there would be  a substantial increase in the world death rate  although many lives could be saved through dramatic action it was already too late to prevent a substantial increase in the global death rate however in reality the global death rate has continued to decline substantially since then from 13 1000 in 1965 74 to 10 1000 from 1985 1990 meanwhile the population of the world has more than doubled while calories consumed person have increased 24  the un does not keep official death-by-hunger statistics so it is hard to measure whether the  hundreds of millions of deaths  number is correct ehrlich himself suggested in 2009 that between 200-300 million had died of hunger since 1968 however that is measured over 40 years rather than the ten to twenty foreseen in the book so it can be seen as significantly fewer than predicted
famine has not been eliminated but its root cause has been political instability not global food shortage the indian economist and nobel prize winner amartya sen has argued that nations with democracy and a free press have virtually never suffered from extended famines and while a 2010 un report stated that 925 million of the world s population of nearly seven billion people were in a constant state of hunger it also notes that the percentage of the world s population who qualify as  undernourished  has fallen by more than half from 33 percent to about 16 percent since ehrlich published the population bomb
ehrlich writes   i don t see how india could possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980  this view was widely held at the time as another statement of his later in the book   i have yet to meet anyone familiar with the situation who thinks that india will be self-sufficient in food by 1971  in the book s 1971 edition the latter prediction was removed as the food situation in india suddenly improved
as of 2010 india had almost 1.2 billion people having nearly tripled its population from around 400 million in 1960 india s total fertility rate in 2008 was calculated to be 2.6 while the absolute numbers of malnourished children in india is high the rates of malnutrition and poverty in india have declined from approximately 90  at the time of india s independence to less than 40  today ehrlich s prediction about famines were found to be false although food security is an issue in india however most epidemiologists public health physicians and demographers identify corruption as the chief cause of malnutrition not  overpopulation  as nobel prize winning economist amartya sen noted india frequently had famines during british colonial rule however when india became a democracy there have been no recorded famines
journalist dan gardner has criticized ehrlich both for his overconfident predictions and his refusal to acknowledge his errors  in two lengthy interviews ehrlich admitted making not a single major error in the popular works he published in the late 1960s and early 1970s   the only flat-out mistake ehrlich acknowledges is missing the destruction of the rain forests which happens to be a point that supports and strengthens his world view and is therefore in cognitive dissonance terms not a mistake at all beyond that he was by his account off a little here and there but only because the information he got from others was wrong basically he was right across the board 
jonathan last called it  one of the most spectacularly foolish books ever published 
showmanship
one frequent criticism of the population bomb is that it focused on spectacle and exaggeration at the expense of accuracy pierre desrochers and christine hoffbauer remark that  at the time of writing the population bomb paul and anne ehrlich should have been more cautious and revised their tone and rhetoric in light of the undeniable and already apparent errors and shortcomings of osborn and vogt s analyses  charles rubin has written that it was precisely because ehrlich was largely unoriginal and wrote in a clear emotionally gripping style that it became so popular he quotes a review from natural history noting that ehrlich does not try to  convince intellectually by mind dulling statistics  but rather roars  like an old testament prophet  gardner says  as much as the events and culture of the era paul ehrlich s style explain the enormous audience he attracted  indeed an appearance on the tonight show starring johnny carson helped to propel the success of the book as well as ehrlich s celebrity desrochers and hoffbauer go on to conclude that it seems hard to deny that using an alarmist tone and emotional appeal were the main lessons that the present generation of environmentalists learned from ehrlich s success
criticism by marxists
on the political left the book received criticism that it was focusing on  the wrong problem  and that the real issue was distribution of resources rather than of overpopulation marxists worried that ehrlich s work could be used to justify genocide and imperial control as well as oppression of minorities and disadvantaged groups or even a return to eugenics barry commoner argued that the ehrlichs were too focused on overpopulation as the source of environmental problems and that their proposed solutions were politically unacceptable because of the coercion that they implied and because the cost would fall disproportionately on the poor he argued that technological and above all social development would lead to a natural decrease in both population growth and environmental damage
ehrlich s response
in a 2004 grist magazine interview ehrlich acknowledged some specific predictions he had made in the years around the time the population bomb was published that had not come to pass however as to a number of his fundamental ideas and assertions he maintained that facts and science proved them correct
in answer to the question   were your predictions in the population bomb right   ehrlich responded 
in another retrospective article published in 2009 ehrlich said in response to criticism that many of his predictions had not come to pass
