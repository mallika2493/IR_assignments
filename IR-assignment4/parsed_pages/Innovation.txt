innovation - wikipedia
innovation is defined simply as a  new idea device or method  however innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements unarticulated needs or existing market needs this is accomplished through more-effective products processes services technologies or business models that are readily available to markets governments and society the term  innovation  can be defined as something original and more effective and as a consequence new that  breaks into  the market or society it is related to but not the same as invention
while a novel device is often described as an innovation in economics management science and other fields of practice and analysis innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in a way that they affect society in industrial economics innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet the growing consumer demand


definition
in a survey of literature on innovation edison et al found over 40 definitions they also performed an industrial survey to capture how innovation is defined in the software industry after analysis of the existing definitions whether these definitions comprehensively cover all the dimensions of innovation they found the following definition to be the most complete 
this definition was given by crossan and apaydin and it builds on the oecd manual s definition
edison et al also found two interesting dimensions of innovation including  degree of novelty  ie whether an innovation is new to the firm new to the market new to the industry and new to the world  and type of innovation  whether it is process or product service innovation 
inter-disciplinary views
business and economics
in business and economics innovation can be a catalyst to growth with rapid advancements in transportation and communications over the past few decades the old world concepts of factor endowments and comparative advantage which focused on an area s unique inputs are outmoded for today s global economy economist joseph schumpeter who contributed greatly to the study of innovation economics argued that industries must incessantly revolutionize the economic structure from within that is innovate with better or more effective processes and products as well as market distribution such as the connection from the craft shop to factory he famously asserted that  creative destruction is the essential fact about capitalism  in addition entrepreneurs continuously look for better ways to satisfy their consumer base with improved quality durability service and price which come to fruition in innovation with advanced technologies and organizational strategies
one prime example was the explosive boom of silicon valley startups out of the stanford industrial park in 1957 dissatisfied employees of shockley semiconductor the company of nobel laureate and co-inventor of the transistor william shockley left to form an independent firm fairchild semiconductor after several years fairchild developed into a formidable presence in the sector eventually these founders left to start their own companies based on their own unique latest ideas and then leading employees started their own firms over the next 20 years this snowball process launched the momentous startup company explosion of information technology firms essentially silicon valley began as 65 new enterprises born out of shockley s eight former employees since then hubs of innovation have sprung up globally with similar metonyms including silicon alley encompassing new york city
organizations
in the organizational context innovation may be linked to positive changes in efficiency productivity quality competitiveness and market share however recent research findings highlight the complementary role of organizational culture in enabling organizations to translate innovative activity into tangible performance improvements organizations can also improve profits and performance by providing work groups opportunities and resources to innovate in addition to employee s core job tasks peter drucker wrote 
according to clayton christensen disruptive innovation is the key to future success in business the organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage it is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage it is a time of risk but even greater opportunity the world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive this will affect employment as businesses will be forced to reduce the number of people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more
all organizations can innovate including for example hospitals universities and local governments for instance former mayor martin o malley pushed the city of baltimore to use citistat a performance-measurement data and management system that allows city officials to maintain statistics on crime trends to condition of potholes this system aids in better evaluation of policies and procedures with accountability and efficiency in terms of time and money in its first year citistat saved the city  13.2 million even mass transit systems have innovated with hybrid bus fleets to real-time tracking at bus stands in addition the growing use of mobile data terminals in vehicles that serve as communication hubs between vehicles and a control center automatically send data on location passenger counts engine performance mileage and other information this tool helps to deliver and manage transportation systems
still other innovative strategies include hospitals digitizing medical information in electronic medical records for example the us department of housing and urban development s hope vi initiatives turned severely distressed public housing in urban areas into revitalized mixed-income environments  the harlem children s zone used a community-based approach to educate local area children  and the environmental protection agency s brownfield grants facilitates turning over brownfields for environmental protection green spaces community and commercial development
sources of innovation
there are several sources of innovation it can occur as a result of a focus effort by a range of different agents by chance or as a result of a major system failure
according to peter f drucker the general sources of innovations are different changes in industry structure in market structure in local and global demographics in human perception mood and meaning in the amount of already available scientific knowledge etc
in the simplest linear model of innovation the traditionally recognized source is manufacturer innovation this is where an agent  person or business  innovates in order to sell the innovation
another source of innovation only now becoming widely recognized is end-user innovation this is where an agent  person or company  develops an innovation for their own  personal or in-house  use because existing products do not meet their needs mit economist eric von hippel has identified end-user innovation as by far the most important and critical in his classic book on the subject the sources of innovation
the robotics engineer joseph f engelberger asserts that innovations require only three things 
however innovation processes usually involve  identifying customer needs macro and meso trends developing competences and finding financial support
the kline chain-linked model of innovation places emphasis on potential market needs as drivers of the innovation process and describes the complex and often iterative feedback loops between marketing design manufacturing and r d
innovation by businesses is achieved in many ways with much attention now given to formal research and development  r d  for  breakthrough innovations  r d help spur on patents and other scientific innovations that leads to productive growth in such areas as industry medicine engineering and government yet innovations can be developed by less formal on-the-job modifications of practice through exchange and combination of professional experience and by many other routes the more radical and revolutionary innovations tend to emerge from r d while more incremental innovations may emerge from practice   but there are many exceptions to each of these trends
information technology and changing business processes and management style can produce a work climate favorable to innovation for example the software tool company atlassian conducts quarterly  shipit days  in which employees may work on anything related to the company s products google employees work on self directed projects for 20  of their time  known as innovation time off  both companies cite these bottom-up processes as major sources for new products and features
an important innovation factor includes customers buying products or using services as a result firms may incorporate users in focus groups  user centred approach  work closely with so called lead users  lead user approach  or users might adapt their products themselves the lead user method focuses on idea generation based on leading users to develop breakthrough innovations u-stir a project to innovate europe s surface transportation system employs such workshops regarding this user innovation a great deal of innovation is done by those actually implementing and using technologies and products as part of their normal activities in most of the times user innovators have some personal record motivating them sometimes user-innovators may become entrepreneurs selling their product they may choose to trade their innovation in exchange for other innovations or they may be adopted by their suppliers nowadays they may also choose to freely reveal their innovations using methods like open source in such networks of innovation the users or communities of users can further develop technologies and reinvent their social meaning
goals and failures
programs of organizational innovation are typically tightly linked to organizational goals and objectives to the business plan and to market competitive positioning one driver for innovation programs in corporations is to achieve growth objectives as davila et al  2006  notes  companies cannot grow through cost reduction and reengineering alone innovation is the key element in providing aggressive top-line growth and for increasing bottom-line results 
one survey across a large number of manufacturing and services organizations found ranked in decreasing order of popularity that systematic programs of organizational innovation are most frequently driven by  improved quality creation of new markets extension of the product range reduced labor costs improved production processes reduced materials reduced environmental damage replacement of products services reduced energy consumption conformance to regulations
these goals vary between improvements to products processes and services and dispel a popular myth that innovation deals mainly with new product development most of the goals could apply to any organisation be it a manufacturing facility marketing firm hospital or local government whether innovation goals are successfully achieved or otherwise depends greatly on the environment prevailing in the firm
conversely failure can develop in programs of innovations the causes of failure have been widely researched and can vary considerably some causes will be external to the organization and outside its influence of control others will be internal and ultimately within the control of the organization internal causes of failure can be divided into causes associated with the cultural infrastructure and causes associated with the innovation process itself common causes of failure within the innovation process in most organizations can be distilled into five types  poor goal definition poor alignment of actions to goals poor participation in teams poor monitoring of results poor communication and access to information
diffusion
diffusion of innovation research was first started in 1903 by seminal researcher gabriel tarde who first plotted the s-shaped diffusion curve tarde defined the innovation-decision process as a series of steps that includes 
once innovation occurs innovations may be spread from the innovator to other individuals and groups this process has been proposed that the life cycle of innovations can be described using the  s-curve  or diffusion curve the s-curve maps growth of revenue or productivity against time in the early stage of a particular innovation growth is relatively slow as the new product establishes itself at some point customers begin to demand and the product growth increases more rapidly new incremental innovations or changes to the product allow growth to continue towards the end of its lifecycle growth slows and may even begin to decline in the later stages no amount of new investment in that product will yield a normal rate of return
the s-curve derives from an assumption that new products are likely to have  product life    ie a start-up phase a rapid increase in revenue and eventual decline in fact the great majority of innovations never get off the bottom of the curve and never produce normal returns
innovative companies will typically be working on new innovations that will eventually replace older ones successive s-curves will come along to replace older ones and continue to drive growth upwards in the figure above the first curve shows a current technology the second shows an emerging technology that currently yields lower growth but will eventually overtake current technology and lead to even greater levels of growth the length of life will depend on many factors
measures
henry et al in their review of literature on innovation management found 232 innovation metrics they categorized these measures along five dimensions ie inputs to the innovation process output from the innovation process effect of the innovation output measures to assess the activities in an innovation process and availability of factors that facilitate such a process
there are two different types of measures for innovation  the organizational level and the political level
organizational level
the measure of innovation at the organizational level relates to individuals team-level assessments and private companies from the smallest to the largest company measure of innovation for organizations can be conducted by surveys workshops consultants or internal benchmarking there is today no established general way to measure organizational innovation corporate measurements are generally structured around balanced scorecards which cover several aspects of innovation such as business measures related to finances innovation process efficiency employees  contribution and motivation as well benefits for customers measured values will vary widely between businesses covering for example new product revenue spending in r d time to market customer and employee perception   satisfaction number of patents additional sales resulting from past innovations
political level
for the political level measures of innovation are more focused on a country or region competitive advantage through innovation in this context organizational capabilities can be evaluated through various evaluation frameworks such as those of the european foundation for quality management the oecd oslo manual  1995  suggests standard guidelines on measuring technological product and process innovation some people consider the oslo manual complementary to the frascati manual from 1963 the new oslo manual from 2005 takes a wider perspective to innovation and includes marketing and organizational innovation these standards are used for example in the european community innovation surveys
other ways of measuring innovation have traditionally been expenditure for example investment in r d  research and development  as percentage of gnp  gross national product  whether this is a good measurement of innovation has been widely discussed and the oslo manual has incorporated some of the critique against earlier methods of measuring the traditional methods of measuring still inform many policy decisions the eu lisbon strategy has set as a goal that their average expenditure on r d should be 3  of gdp
indicators
many scholars claim that there is a great bias towards the  science and technology mode   s t-mode or sti-mode  while the  learning by doing using and interacting mode   dui-mode  is widely ignored for an example that means you can have the better high tech or software but there are also crucial learning tasks important for innovation but these measurements and research are rarely done
a common industry view  unsupported by empirical evidence  is that comparative cost-effectiveness research  cer  is a form of price control which by reducing returns to industry limits r d expenditure stifles future innovation and compromises new products access to markets some academics claim the cer is a valuable value-based measure of innovation which accords truly significant advances in therapy  those that provide  health gain   higher prices than free market mechanisms such value-based pricing has been viewed as a means of indicating to industry the type of innovation that should be rewarded from the public purse the australian academic thomas alured faunce has developed the case that national comparative cost-effectiveness assessment systems should be viewed as measuring  health innovation  as an evidence-based concept distinct from valuing innovation through the operation of competitive markets  a method which requires strong anti-trust laws to be effective  on the basis that both methods of assessing innovation in pharmaceuticals are mentioned in annex 2c.1 of the ausfta
rate of innovation
innovation indices
several indices attempt to measure innovation and rank entities based on these measures such as 
innovation rankings
many research studies try to rank countries based on measures of innovation common areas of focus include  high-tech companies manufacturing patents post secondary education research and development and research personnel the following is a ranking of the top 10 countries in the 2015 bloomberg innovation index 
future of innovation
jonathan huebner a physicist working at the pentagon s naval air warfare center argued on the basis of both us patents and world technological breakthroughs per capita that the rate of human technological innovation peaked in 1873 and has been slowing ever since in his article he asked  will the level of technology reach a maximum and then decline as in the dark ages   in later comments to new scientist magazine huebner clarified that while he believed that we will reach a rate of innovation in 2024 equivalent to that of the dark ages he was not predicting the reoccurrence of the dark ages themselves
his paper received some mainstream news coverage at the time
the claim has been met with criticism by john smart who asserted that research by technological singularity researcher ray kurzweil and others showed a  clear trend of acceleration not deceleration  when it came to innovations the foundation issued a reply to huebner in the pages of the journal his article was published in citing the existence of second life and eharmony as proof of accelerating innovation  huebner also replied to this however in 2010 joseph a tainter deborah strumsky and jos  lobo confirmed huebner s findings using us patent office data additional verification was provided in a 2012 paper by robert j gordon
innovation and international development
the theme of innovation as a tool to disrupting patterns of poverty has gained momentum since the mid-2000s among major international development actors such as dfid gates foundation s use of the grand challenge funding model and usaid s global development lab networks have been established to support innovation in development such as d-lab at mit investment funds have been established to identify and catalyze innovations in developing countries such as dfid s global innovation fund human development innovation fund and  in partnership with usaid  the global development innovation ventures
government policies
given the noticeable effects on efficiency quality of life and productive growth innovation is a key factor in society and economy consequently policymakers have long worked to develop environments that will foster innovation and its resulting positive benefits from funding research and development to supporting regulatory change funding the development of innovation clusters and using public purchasing and standardisation to  pull  innovation through
for instance experts are advocating that the us federal government launch a national infrastructure foundation a nimble collaborative strategic intervention organization that will house innovations programs from fragmented silos under one entity inform federal officials on innovation performance metrics strengthen industry-university partnerships and support innovation economic development initiatives especially to strengthen regional clusters because clusters are the geographic incubators of innovative products and processes a cluster development grant program would also be targeted for implementation by focusing on innovating in such areas as precision manufacturing information technology and clean energy other areas of national concern would be tackled including government debt carbon footprint and oil dependence the us economic development administration understand this reality in their continued regional innovation clusters initiative in addition federal grants in r d a crucial driver of innovation and productive growth should be expanded to levels similar to japan finland south korea and switzerland in order to stay globally competitive also such grants should be better procured to metropolitan areas the essential engines of the american economy
many countries recognize the importance of research and development as well as innovation including japan s ministry of education culture sports science and technology  mext   germany s federal ministry of education and research  and the ministry of science and technology in the people s republic of china furthermore russia s innovation programme is the medvedev modernisation programme which aims at creating a diversified economy based on high technology and innovation also the government of western australia has established a number of innovation incentives for government departments landgate was the first western australian government agency to establish its innovation program the cairns region established the tropical innovation awards in 2010 open to all businesses in australia the 2011 awards were extended to include participants from all tropical zone countries
innovators
an innovator in a general sense is a person or an organization who is one of the first to introduce into reality something better than before something that opens up a new area for others and achieves an innovation
