as of 2016 the who website on environmental health states  environmental health addresses all the physical chemical and biological factors external to a person and all the related factors impacting behaviours it encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health it is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments this definition excludes behaviour not related to environment as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment as well as genetics

the term environmental medicine may be seen as a medical specialty or branch of the broader field of environmental health terminology is not fully established and in many european countries they are used interchangeably
environmental health profession
environmental health professionals may be known as environmental health officers public health inspectors environmental health specialists environmental health practitioners or sanitarians researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field in many european countries physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health in the united kingdom practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the chartered institute of environmental health or the royal environmental health institute of scotland in canada practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor s degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate the certificate in public health inspection  canada  cphi c  many states in the united states also require that individuals have a bachelor s degree and professional licenses in order to practice environmental health california state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows

disciplines
three basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health  environmental epidemiology toxicology and exposure science each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems in environmental health but there is some overlap among them
information from these three disciplines can be combined to conduct a risk assessment for specific chemicals mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health  exposure would likely result in the development of pollution-related diseases  this can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that for example regulates chemical emissions or imposes standards for proper sanitation
concerns
environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment environmental health concerns include 
according to recent estimates about 5 to 10  of disability-adjusted life years  dalys  lost are due to environmental causes in europe by far the most important factor is fine particulate matter pollution in urban air similarly environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million  8.7   deaths and 86 million  5.7   dalys globally in the united states superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities it was this perceived threat raising the specter of miscarriages mutations birth defects and cancers that most frightened the public
