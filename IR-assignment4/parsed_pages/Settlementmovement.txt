victorian england increasingly concerned with poverty gave rise to the movement whereby those connected to universities settled students in slum areas to live and work alongside local people through their efforts settlement houses were established for education savings sports and arts such institutions were often praised by religious representatives concerned with the lives of the poor and criticized as normative or moralistic by radical social movements
there were basic commonalities in the movement these institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty especially the changes that came with industrialization rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty the settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities
