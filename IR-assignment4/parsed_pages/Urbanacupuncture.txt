urban acupuncture - wikipedia
urban acupuncture is a socio-environmental theory that combines contemporary urban design with traditional chinese acupuncture using small-scale interventions to transform the larger urban context sites are selected through analysis of aggregate social economic and ecological factors and are developed through a dialogue between designers and the community just as the practice of acupuncture is aimed at relieving stress in the human body the goal of urban acupuncture is to relieve stress in the built environment in taipei there was an urban acupuncture workshop that aimed to  produce small-scale but socially catalytic interventions  into the city s fabric


urban organism
originally coined by barcelonan architect and urbanist manuel de sola morales the term has been recently championed and developed further by finnish architect and social theorist marco casagrande this school of thought eschews massive urban renewal projects in favour of a more localised and community approach that in an era of constrained budgets and limited resources could democratically and cheaply offer a respite to urban dwellers casagrande views cities as complex energy organisms in which different overlapping layers of energy flows are determining the actions of the citizens as well as the development of the city by mixing environmentalism and urban design casagrande is developing methods of punctual manipulation of the urban energy flows in order to create an ecologically sustainable urban development towards the so-called 3rd generation city  postindustrial city  the theory is developed in the tamkang university of taiwan and at independent multidisciplinary research center ruin academy with focus on environmentalism and urban design casagrande defines urban acupuncture as a design tool where punctual manipulations contribute to creating sustainable urban development such as the community gardens and urban farms in taipei
casagrande describes urban acupuncture as 
casagrande utilized the tenets of acupuncture  treat the points of blockage and let relief ripple throughout the body more immediate and sensitive to community needs than traditional institutional forms of large scale urban renewal interventions would not only respond to localized needs but do so with a knowledge of how city-wide systems operated and converged at that single node release pressure at strategic points release pressure for the whole city
participatory planning
in theory urban acupuncture opens the door for uncontrolled creativity and freedom citizens are enabled to join the creative participatory planning process feel free to use city space for any purpose and develop their environment according to their will this  new  post-industrialized city casagrande dubbed the third generation city is driven by people who are concerned about the destruction that the modern machine is causing to nature including human nature they want susstainable co-operation with the rest of the nature in a larger context a site of urban acupuncture can be viewed as communicating to the city outside like a natural sign of life in a city programmed to subsume it
urban acupuncture bears some similarities to the new urbanist concept of tactical urbanism the idea focuses on local resources rather than capital-intensive municipal programs and promotes the idea of citizens installing and caring for interventions these small changes proponents claim will boost community morale and catalyze revitalization boiled down to a simple statement  urban acupuncture  means focusing on small subtle bottom-up interventions that harness and direct community energy in positive ways to heal urban blight and improve the cityscape it is meant as an alternative to large top-down mega-interventions that typically require heavy investments of municipal funds  which many cities at the moment simply don t have  and the navigation of yards of bureaucratic red tape the micro-scale interventions targeted by  urban acupuncture  appeal to both citizen-activists and cash-strapped communities in mexico urban acupuncture refers to a concept that converts temporary housing like sheds in the slums to simple homes that allow for  add-ons  later based on need and affordability this strategy transforms the slum zone without relocating families that have been living together for generations in south africa urban acupuncture is viewed as a possibility to provide a means for people to unlock their creativity and the advantages thereof for example innovation and entrepreneurship concentrating on parts of the city ie communities thereby providing opportunities to those areas which do not have the sort of infrastructure that is found in mainstream cities this approach can provide a more realistic and less costly method for city planners and citizens as an effective way to make minor improvements in the communities in order to achieve a greater good in the cities
jaime lerner the former mayor of curitiba suggests urban acupuncture as the future solution for contemporary urban issues  by focusing on very narrow pressure points in cities we can initiate positive ripple effects for the greater society urban acupuncture reclaims the ownership of land to the public and emphasizes the importance of community development through small interventions in design of cities it involves pinpointed interventions that can be accomplished quickly to release energy and create a positive ripple effect he described in 2007 
 i believe that some medicinal  magic  can and should be applied to cities as many are sick and some nearly terminal as with the medicine needed in the interaction between doctor and patient in urban planning it is also necessary to make the city react  to poke an area in such a way that it is able to help heal improve and create positive chain reactions it is indispensable in revitalizing interventions to make the organism work in a different way 
taiwanese architect and academic ti-nan chi is looking with micro urbanism at the vulnerable and insignificant side of contemporary cities around the world identified as micro-zones points for recovery in which micro-projects have been carefully proposed to involve the public on different levels aiming to resolve conflicts among property owners villagers and the general public
a loosely affiliated team of architects wang shu marco casagrande hsieh ying-chun and roan ching-yueh  sometimes called weak  architecture  are describing the unofficial instant city or instant taipei as architecture that uses the official city as a growing platform and energy source where to attach itself like a parasite and from where to leach the electricity and water   illegal urban farms or night markets is so widespread and deep rooted in the taiwanese culture and cityscape that we could almost speak of another city on top of the  official  taipei a parallel city   or a para-city weak  is calling urban acupuncture depending on the context as illegal architecture orchid architecture the people s architecture or weak architecture the theory of urban acupuncture suggests that scores of small-scale less costly and localized projects is what cities need in order to recover and renew themselves

urban ecological restoration
in ecological restoration of industrial cities urban acupuncture can take form as spontaneous and often illegal urban farms and community gardens punctuating the more mechanical city and tuning it towards a more sustainable co-existence with the natural environment urban acupuncture areas can receive treat and recycle the waste from the surrounding city acting as eco-valleys within the urban fabric in river urbanism the urban acupuncture areas can include underground stormwater reservoirs and act as flood relief for the surrounding city as a sponge and they can act as biological filters purifying water originated from polluted rivers urban acupuncture is a point by point manipulation of the urban energy to create a sustainable town or city which marco casagrande has dubbed  3rd generation cities 
urban acupuncture in art
