ecological anthropology - wikipedia
ecological anthropology is a sub-field of anthropology and is defined as the  study of cultural adaptations to environments  the sub-field is also defined as  the study of relationships between a population of humans and their biophysical environment  the focus of its research concerns  how cultural beliefs and practices helped human populations adapt to their environments and how people used elements of their culture to maintain their ecosystems  ecological anthropology developed from the approach of cultural ecology and it provided a conceptual framework more suitable for scientific inquiry than the cultural ecology approach research pursued under this approach aims to study a wide range of human responses to environmental problems


history of the domain and leading researchers
in the 1960s ecological anthropology first appeared as a response to cultural ecology a sub-field of anthropology led by julian steward steward focused on studying different modes of subsistence as methods of energy transfer and then analyzed how they determine other aspects of culture culture became the unit of analysis the first ecological anthropologists explored the idea that humans as ecological populations should be the unit of analysis and culture became the means by which that population alters and adapts to the environment it was characterised by systems theory functionalism and negative feedback analysis
benjamin s orlove has noted that the development of ecological anthropology has occurred in stages  each stage is a reaction to the previous one rather than merely an addition to it  the first stage concerns the work of julian steward and leslie white the second stage is titled  neofunctionalism  and or  neoevolutionism  and the third stage is termed  processual ecological anthropology  during the first stage two different models were developed by both white and steward  the distinction is not as rigid as some critics have made it out to be white s models of cultural evolution were unilinear and monocausal whereas steward admitted a number of different lines of cultural development and a number of different causal factors during the second stage it was noted that the later group agreed with steward and white while the other disagreed  neoevolutionists  borrowed from the work of charles darwin the general approach suggested that  evolution is progressive and leads towards new and better forms in succeeding periods   neofunctionalists   see the social organization and culture of specific populations as functional adaptations which permit the populations to exploit their environments successfully without exceeding their carrying capacity   processual ecological anthropology  is noted to be new studies based on this approach  seek to overcome the split in the second stage of ecological anthropology between excessively short and long time scales  the approach more specifically examines  shifts and changes in individual and group activities and they focus on the mechanism by which behavior and external constraints influence each other 
one of the leading practitioners within this sub-field of anthropology was roy rappaport he delivered many outstanding works on the relationship between culture and the natural environment in which it grows especially concerning the role of ritual in the processual relationship between the two he conducted the majority if not all of his fieldwork amongst a group known as the maring who inhabit an area in the highlands of papua new guinea
patricia k townsend s work highlights the difference between ecological anthropology and environmental anthropology in her view some anthropologists use both terms in an interchangeable fashion she states that  ecological anthropology will refer to one particular type of research in environmental anthropology   field studies that describe a single ecosystem including a human population  studies conducted under this sub-field  frequently deal with a small population of only a few hundred people such as a village or neighbourhood 
globalization effects on the discipline
studies under the discipline are concerned with the ethnoecologies of indigenous populations due to various factors associated with globalization indigenous ethnoecologies are facing increasing challenges such as  migration media and commerce spread people institutions information and technology   in the face of national and international incentives to exploit and degrade ethnological systems that once preserved local and regional environments increasingly are ineffective or irrelevant  threats also exist of  commercial logging industrial pollution and the imposition of external management systems  on their local ecosystems these threats to indigenous ways of life are a familiar occurrence in the field of anthropology conrad phillip kottak states that  today s ecological anthropology  aka environmental anthropology attempts not only to understand but also to find solutions to environmental problems 
criticisms of ecological anthropology
from the beginning various scholars criticised the discipline saying it inherently was too focused on static equilibrii which ignored change that it used circular reasoning and that it oversimplified systems one of the current criticisms is that in its original form ecological anthropology relies upon cultural relativism as the norm however in today s world there are few cultures that are isolated enough to live in a true culturally relative state instead cultures are being influenced and changed by media governments ngos businesses etc in response the discipline has seen a shift towards applied ecological anthropology political ecology and environmental anthropology
