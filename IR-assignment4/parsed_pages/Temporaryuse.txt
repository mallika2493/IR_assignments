temporary use - wikipedia
temporary use of empty spaces is a practice in urbanism aiming to revitalize empty spaces in urban areas especially abandoned and decaying buildings
many spaces are left empty by owners because they currently do not have plans with the space no capital for its renovation or further building or cannot sell or rent the space at the price they want instead of waiting with an empty space which can often mean being additional taxed by the municipality they can offer a temporary use of the space this allows various community members to obtain the space for their social cultural or other needs under often more favorable terms the property owner often has less requirements than in the case of a normal lease  they do not have to maintain the spaces and can cancel the use at a much shorter notice on the other hand temporary users can use the space at no or symbolical cost and often maintain the spaces themselves
such approach is perceived as win-win for both property owners who get tax benefits and users and a wider city community who get new content in those spaces moreover buildings are less prone to decay because they are in use furthermore such use is intrinsically bottom-up driven by citizens and can demonstrate needs in a city which would otherwise be left undiscovered
criticism
many temporary use projects prove the benefit to the city and develop and go beyond the merely temporary use of buildings this requires that temporary use is re-imagined and restructured
