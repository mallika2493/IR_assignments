company town - wikipedia
a company town is a place where practically all stores and housing are owned by the one company that is also the main employer company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores churches schools markets and recreation facilities
the best examples of company towns have had high ideals  but many have been regarded as paternalistic or exploitative others developed more or less in unplanned fashion such as summit hill pennsylvania one of the oldest which began as a lc n co mining camp and mine site nine miles from the nearest outside road


overview
traditional settings for company towns were where extractive industries   coal metal mines lumber   had established a monopoly franchise dam sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns it was possible to pay in scrip through a truck system in the soviet union there were several cities of nuclear scientists  atomicals  known as atomgrad  particularly in ukraine those were pripyat varash yuzhnoukrainsk among others
typically a company town is isolated from neighbors and centered on a large production factory such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant  and the citizens of the town either work in the factory work in one of the smaller businesses or is a family member of someone who does the company may also donate a church building to a local congregation operate parks host cultural events such as concerts and so on if the owning company cuts back or goes out of business the economic effect on the company town is devastating as people move to jobs elsewhere
company towns often become regular public cities and towns as they grow and attract other settlement business enterprises and pool transportation and services infrastructure other times a town may not officially be a company town but it may be a town where the majority of citizens are employed by a single company thus creating a similar situation to a company town  especially in regard to the town s economy  further such dependencies extend to neighborhoods and regions of larger cities in each case if the primary company falls on lean times fails outright or the industry fades in importance  as with steam locomotive support rail yards and anthracite mining industries which depended on steam locomotives spurring demands  the communities contract and lose property value and then population as people move to find work elsewhere and the youth of the community bears the children of their generation in another demographic region
history
paternalism
paternalism a subtle form of social engineering refers to the control of workers by their employers who sought to force middle-class ideals upon their working-class employees paternalism was considered by many nineteenth-century businessmen as a moral responsibility or often a religious obligation which would advance society whilst furthering their own business interests accordingly the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends
although many prominent examples of company towns portray their founders as  capitalists with a conscience  for example george cadbury s bournville if viewed cynically the company town was often an economically viable ploy to attract and retain workers additionally for-profit shops within company towns were usually owned by the company which were unavoidable to its isolated workers thus resulting in a monopoly for the owners
although economically successful company towns sometimes failed politically due to a lack of elected officials and municipally owned services accordingly workers often had no say in local affairs and therefore felt dictated ultimately this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents eventually losing long-term affection for their towns  such was the case at pullman
pullman lesson
although many small company towns existed in mining areas of pennsylvania before the civil war one of the largest and most substantial early company towns in the united states was pullman developed in the 1880s just outside the chicago city limits the town entirely company-owned provided housing markets a library churches and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents employees were required to live in pullman although cheaper rentals could be found in nearby communities
the town operated successfully until the economic panic of 1893 when demands for the company s products declined and employee wages had to be lowered accordingly despite this the company refused to lower rents in the town or the price of goods at its shops thus resulting in the pullman strike of 1894 a national commission formed to investigate the causes of the strikes found that pullman s paternalism was partly to blame and labelled it  un-american 
however government observers maintained that pullman s principles were accurate in that he provided his employees with a quality of life otherwise unattainable to them but recognised that his excessive paternalism was inappropriate for a large-scale corporate economy and thus caused the town s downfall accordingly government observers and social reformers alike saw the need for a balance between control and well-designed towns concluding that a model company town would only succeed if independent professionals acting as a buffer between employers and employees took a role in conception planning and management of these towns in 1898 the illinois supreme court required pullman to dissolve their ownership of the town
historian linda carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by george pullman in the 1880s she says they 
thus the pullman strike did not kill the concept of a company town but rather initiated a new chapter in their existence over the next thirty years the old model of paternalism was abandoned in favour of new professionally designed company towns with architects landscape architects and planners translating  new concepts of industrial relations and social welfare into new physical forms  this suited capitalists of the day who were obviously keen to avoid the experiences of pullman the first real example of this occurred at indian hill-north village massachusetts in 1915
decline of american company towns
by the 1920s the need for company towns had declined significantly due to increased national affluence despite income inequalities and a relatively low standard of living conditions amongst factory laborers the prosperity of the 1920s saw workers  material well-being improve significantly a strong post-war american economy meant installment buying was accessible to low-wage earners who could now purchase previously unattainable goods like automobiles and radios moreover workers were no longer dependent on employers for healthcare and education
by the 1920s the widespread nature of the automobile meant workers no longer needed to live near their work places and now had access to more employment opportunities a combination of the freedom that came with private transport and the mass communication of radio saw the isolation of company towns lessen and the social basis of the company town become less necessary
furthermore the accessibility of the working class to private transport also marked a step of equality as they had previously only been accessible to the wealthy as access to surrounding municipalities increased residents of company towns gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools libraries and parks accordingly there was no longer a need for the amenities of company towns which prior to welfare capitalism had previously been unattainable to the working class
this new found freedom saw a change in the mindset of workers who began to look on welfare capitalism as demeaning rather than an incentive accordingly many employees began to request additional pay in lieu of welfare programs this was well received by some employers as the idea of  laissez-faire  individualism which promoted entrepreneurial virtues of hard-work being rewarded rather than direct charity began to shape new-age paternalism
modernization and the increase in material well-being had also lessened the perceived need for paternalism and moral reform consequently the economic downturn of the early 1930s saw some businesses do away with employee welfare schemes to reduce costs however the roosevelt administration s new deal dealt the final blow to end american company towns by raising minimum wages encouraging industrial self-governance and pushing for the owners of company towns to  consider the question of plans for eventual employee ownership of homes  to a lesser extent the new deal also reduced the need for employee housing by transforming housing finance to a lower-interest lower-deposit system making home ownership more accessible to the working class
model company towns
during the late nineteenth century model company towns materialised as enlightened industrialists recognised that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions these industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working class districts in order to create better living conditions for workers model company towns such as port sunlight  1888  and bournville  1895  were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation the ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the garden city movement
the model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees planning a model company town involved the fusion of new notions of house design and layout the paternalism of the enlightened industrialist was exhibited in his desire to provide an environment for his employees that was aesthetically appealing and which included well-designed residences parks schools libraries and meeting halls the industrialist also wished to contribute to his workers  well-being by providing social programs such as sporting events and functions this however highlights the power and immense control possessed by the company owner who could shape the lifestyle and activities of his employees to serve his own interests and those of the company
model villages for agricultural workers were founded in the early 19th century in great britain the creation of model company towns was particularly evident in britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century with the creation of saltaire  1851  bournville port sunlight creswell and new earswick  1901  and coincided with the housing-reform movement which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class these model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in british working-class districts which were often characterized by congested housing unsanitary conditions and poor provision of open space and facilities model company towns promoted the idea of orderly planned town development as well as the notion of planning for the needs of the community in order to provide healthier living conditions
model company towns in britain
model company towns around the mid-nineteenth century such as copley  1849  near halifax and saltaire  1853  close to bradford were differentiated by improved dwellings for workers which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities these model company towns prompted the creation of others such as port sunlight bournville and creswell within an environment of reform
port sunlight  1888  in cheshire was established by william hesketh lever  later lord leverhulme  of lever brothers   a soap and tallow manufacturer the earlier layout of this model company town was planned to suit the undulating topography of the site port sunlight catered for the lever brothers employees through the provision of improved housing  cottages of varying designs and materials  and gardens as well as social and community facilities including an auditorium a school tennis courts and bowling greens port sunlight combined the use of formal and informal planning elements such as straight streets close to the town centre and curved streets in the residential areas this combination of the formal and informal represented a new feature of british town planning
bournville  1895  near birmingham was established by the cadbury brothers george and richard george and richard cadbury chose to transfer the cadbury factory to this new site in order to provide their employees with improved living conditions and a country environment that they could enjoy   a far cry from the busy smoky city centre of birmingham the firm provided education in the form of a compulsory academic course and workers were given the opportunity to complete commercial or technical training the cadburys also encouraged their workers to get involved in the social life of bournville through the provision of sports facilities and athletic and cultural clubs as well as social events such as summer parties george cadbury a quaker preached christian values such as respectability thrift and sobriety and sought to unify the bournville community through rituals such as gift giving between employer and employee the firm also established work councils such as the women s works council and supported trades unions
bournville represented the union of industry and nature as the company town boasted the attractiveness of the countryside and low-density development defined by well-built and visually appealing dwellings unlike port sunlight bournville catered for a mixed community where residences were not restricted to the workforce only bournville illustrated how towards the end of the nineteenth century low-density development was being punctuated along with the provision of open air space and sunlight bournville s gardens parks tree-lined streets sense of spaciousness and country setting enhanced its aesthetic appeal and demonstrated george cadbury s endeavour to provide workers with a healthy beautiful and well-ventilated environment
the bolsover company developed two exemplary mining communities in derbyshire during the late nineteenth century bolsover  1891  and creswell  1896  the bolsover company aimed to provide improved living conditions for the miners and their families in these model industrial villages the houses at creswell were built in concentric circles and within these circles was a large open parkland and a bandstand not only did the bolsover company aim to provide better housing but they also wished to improve workers  moral fibre believing that the provision of facilities and the promotion of workers  welfare would discourage drunkenness gambling and bad language the bolsover company provided facilities deemed beneficial for employees at both villages including clubhouses bowling greens cooperative society stores cricket pitches and schools during the early years of these model industrial villages the bolsover company organized various events intended to enhance community life such as flower shows lectures sporting events concerts teas and dances
industrial colonies in catalonia
catalonia has a high density of company towns known as industrial colonies especially concentrated in the basins of the rivers ter and llobregat in bergued  for example at the distance of 20 km there are 14 colonies the total number in catalonia is up to hundred these are small towns created around a factory built in a rural area and therefore separate from any other population mostly between 100 and 500 inhabitants and in some cases around 1000 people
the industrial colonies are a typical phenomenon of industrialization in catalonia specifically the second industrialization and caused certain areas that were once purely rural areas becoming industrial its creation began in the second half of the nineteenth century specially from 1870s and the last colonies are created in the early years of the twentieth century thus company towns in catalonia have 150 years of history although in almost all cases the company that generated the colony closed the most current industry is textile with more than 75 colonies counted although there are also mining metallurgy and agriculture colonies
mostly these colonies  specially the textile  are settled close to a river because they use hydraulic power to run the factory this was because catalonia is poor in coal and importing it was expensive in addition the catalan rivers  with little volume but very sloping  provide a free and almost inexhaustible energy lacking only in times of drought
the system of the industrial colonies began to collapse in the 1960s the colonies gradually emptied of people even before the definitive industrial crisis which worsened in 1978 in the 80s and 90s of the twentieth century were closed almost all factories in industrial colonies from that moment many colonies became towns independent from a company others were abandoned and remain without inhabitants the factories have been leased to other smaller industries or have remained empty
some interesting colonies that can be mentioned are  col nia g ell in santa coloma de cervell  which contains several modernist buildings such as the crypt church built by antoni gaud   l ametlla de merola puig-reig where centenary traditional cultural activities are held such as the representation of els pastorets  the three colonies of castellbell i el vilar  la bauma el borr s el bur s with interesting architectural value  cal rosal between berga avi  and olvan which in 1858 was the first that begun the era of building large colonies in llobregat  cal vidal puig-reig which hold the museum of the colony vidal ideal for visiting and knowing how a colony was inside

in the present-day united states it is relatively rare for any place in which a single company owns all the property to be granted status as an incorporated municipality rather companies will normally prefer their wholly owned communities to remain unincorporated as this permits administration of the community to be carried out by appointed company officers rather than elected officials however there are incorporated municipalities that are heavily dependent upon a single industry or organization and may be loosely considered a  company town  even though the company does not technically own the town
