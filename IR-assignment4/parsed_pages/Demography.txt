demography - wikipedia
demography  from prefix demo- from ancient greek       d mos meaning  the people  and -graphy from       graph  implies  writing description or measurement   is the statistical study of populations especially human beings as a very general science it can analyse any kind of dynamic living population ie one that changes over time or space  see population dynamics  demography encompasses the study of the size structure and distribution of these populations and spatial or temporal changes in them in response to birth migration ageing and death based on the demographic research of the earth earth s population up to the year 2050 and 2100 can be estimated by demographers demographics are quantifiable characteristics of a given population
demographic analysis can cover whole societies or groups defined by criteria such as education nationality religion and ethnicity educational institutions usually treat demography as a field of sociology though there are a number of independent demography departments
formal demography limits its object of study to the measurement of population processes while the broader field of social demography or population studies also analyses the relationships between economic social cultural and biological processes influencing a population


history
demographic thoughts can be traced back to antiquity and were present in many civilizations and cultures like ancient greece ancient rome india and china in ancient greece this can be found in the writings of herodotus thucidides hippocrates epicurus protagoras polus plato and aristotle in rome writers and philosophers like cicero seneca pliny the elder marcus aurelius epictetus cato and collumella also expressed important ideas on this ground
in the middle ages christian thinkers devoted much time in refuting the classical ideas on demography important contributors to the field were william of conches bartholomew of lucca william of auvergne william of pagula and ibn khaldun
one of the earliest demographic studies in the modern period was natural and political observations made upon the bills of mortality  1662  by john graunt which contains a primitive form of life table among the study s findings were that one third of the children in london died before their sixteenth birthday mathematicians such as edmond halley developed the life table as the basis for life insurance mathematics richard price was credited with the first textbook on life contingencies published in 1771 followed later by augustus de morgan  on the application of probabilities to life contingencies   1838 
at the end of the 18th century thomas robert malthus concluded that if unchecked populations would be subject to exponential growth he feared that population growth would tend to outstrip growth in food production leading to ever-increasing famine and poverty  see malthusian catastrophe  he is seen as the intellectual father of ideas of overpopulation and the limits to growth later more sophisticated and realistic models were presented by benjamin gompertz and verhulst
the period 1860-1910 can be characterized as a period of transition wherein demography emerged from statistics as a separate field of interest this period included a panoply of international  great demographers  like adolphe qu telet  1796 1874  william farr  1807 1883  louis-adolphe bertillon  1821 1883  and his son jacques  1851 1922  joseph k r si  1844 1906  anders nicolas kaier  1838 1919  richard b ckh  1824 1907   mile durkheim  1858-1917  wilhelm lexis  1837 1914  and luigi bodio  1840 1920  contributed to the development of demography and to the toolkit of methods and techniques of demographic analysis
methods
there are two types of data collection direct and indirect with several different methods of each type
direct methods
direct data comes from vital statistics registries that track all births and deaths as well as certain changes in legal status such as marriage divorce and migration  registration of place of residence  in developed countries with good registration systems  such as the united states and much of europe  registry statistics are the best method for estimating the number of births and deaths
a census is the other common direct method of collecting demographic data a census is usually conducted by a national government and attempts to enumerate every person in a country however in contrast to vital statistics data which are typically collected continuously and summarized on an annual basis censuses typically occur only every 10 years or so and thus are not usually the best source of data on births and deaths analyses are conducted after a census to estimate how much over or undercounting took place these compare the sex ratios from the census data to those estimated from natural values and mortality data
censuses do more than just count people they typically collect information about families or households in addition to individual characteristics such as age sex marital status literacy education employment status and occupation and geographical location they may also collect data on migration  or place of birth or of previous residence  language religion nationality  or ethnicity or race  and citizenship in countries in which the vital registration system may be incomplete the censuses are also used as a direct source of information about fertility and mortality  for example the censuses of the people s republic of china gather information on births and deaths that occurred in the 18 months immediately preceding the census
indirect methods
indirect methods of collecting data are required in countries and periods where full data are not available such as is the case in much of the developing world and most of historical demography one of these techniques in contemporary demography is the sister method where survey researchers ask women how many of their sisters have died or had children and at what age with these surveys researchers can then indirectly estimate birth or death rates for the entire population other indirect methods in contemporary demography include asking people about siblings parents and children other indirect methods are necessary in historical demography
there are a variety of demographic methods for modelling population processes they include models of mortality  including the life table gompertz models hazards models cox proportional hazards models multiple decrement life tables brass relational logits  fertility  hernes model coale-trussell models parity progression ratios  marriage  singulate mean at marriage page model  disability  sullivan s method multistate life tables  population projections  lee carter the leslie matrix  and population momentum  keyfitz 
the united kingdom has a series of four national birth cohort studies the first three spaced apart by 12 years  the 1946 national survey of health and development the 1958 national child development study the 1970 british cohort study and the millennium cohort study begun much more recently in 2000 these have followed the lives of samples of people  typically beginning with around 17,000 in each study  for many years and are still continuing as the samples have been drawn in a nationally representative way inferences can be drawn from these studies about the differences between four distinct generations of british people in terms of their health education attitudes childbearing and employment patterns
common rates and ratios
a stable population does not necessarily remain fixed in size it can be expanding or shrinking
note that the crude death rate as defined above and applied to a whole population can give a misleading impression for example the number of deaths per 1,000 people can be higher for developed nations than in less-developed countries despite standards of health being better in developed countries this is because developed countries have proportionally more older people who are more likely to die in a given year so that the overall mortality rate can be higher even if the mortality rate at any given age is lower a more complete picture of mortality is given by a life table which summarizes mortality separately at each age a life table is necessary to give a good estimate of life expectancy
basic equation
suppose that a country  or other entity  contains populationt persons at time t what is the size of the population at time t   1  
natural increase from time t to t   1 
net migration from time t to t   1 
this basic equation can also be applied to subpopulations for example the population size of ethnic groups or nationalities within a given society or country is subject to the same sources of change however when dealing with ethnic groups  net migration  might have to be subdivided into physical migration and ethnic reidentification  assimilation  individuals who change their ethnic self-labels or whose ethnic classification in government statistics changes over time may be thought of as migrating or moving from one population subcategory to another
more generally while the basic demographic equation holds true by definition in practice the recording and counting of events  births deaths immigration emigration  and the enumeration of the total population size are subject to error so allowance needs to be made for error in the underlying statistics when any accounting of population size or change is made
the figure in this section shows the latest  2004  un projections of world population out to the year 2150  red   high orange   medium green   low  the un  medium  projection shows world population reaching an approximate equilibrium at 9 billion by 2075 working independently demographers at the international institute for applied systems analysis in austria expect world population to peak at 9 billion by 2070 throughout the 21st century the average age of the population is likely to continue to rise
science of population
populations can change through three processes  fertility mortality and migration fertility involves the number of children that women have and is to be contrasted with fecundity  a woman s childbearing potential  mortality is the study of the causes consequences and measurement of processes affecting death to members of the population demographers most commonly study mortality using the life table a statistical device which provides information about the mortality conditions  most notably the life expectancy  in the population
migration refers to the movement of persons from a locality of origin to a destination place across some pre-defined political boundary migration researchers do not designate movements  migrations  unless they are somewhat permanent thus demographers do not consider tourists and travellers to be migrating while demographers who study migration typically do so through census data on place of residence indirect sources of data including tax forms and labour force surveys are also important
demography is today widely taught in many universities across the world attracting students with initial training in social sciences statistics or health studies being at the crossroads of several disciplines such as sociology economics epidemiology geography anthropology and history demography offers tools to approach a large range of population issues by combining a more technical quantitative approach that represents the core of the discipline with many other methods borrowed from social or other sciences demographic research is conducted in universities in research institutes as well as in statistical departments and in several international agencies population institutions are part of the cicred  international committee for coordination of demographic research  network while most individual scientists engaged in demographic research are members of the international union for the scientific study of population or a national association such as the population association of america in the united states or affiliates of the federation of canadian demographers in canada
