complete communities - wikipedia
complete communities are an urban planning concept that aims to meet the basic needs of its citizens regardless of income culture or political ideologies through integrated land use planning transportation planning and community design the idea of the complete community has roots in early planning theory beginning with the garden city movement and is a componenent of contemporary planning methods including smart growth


history
the garden city movement was one of the first proponents for creating communities that accommodate a wide range of community members through a mix in housing types and uses increasing urban sprawl and its associated negative social environmental and health effects prompted a turn in theory towards increasing density in urban areas this idea has been brought into contemporary theoretical movements including smart growth new urbanism and sustainable development which all advocate high-density  compact  communities and also elaborate on the mix of activities and land uses that contribute to a complete community the  complete community  is seen as a way to deal with issues of social isolation address inefficient land uses and meeti the needs of diverse households
more attractive and efficient communities through compact form mixed-use higher densities and a range of housing types has been a goal of canadian planning policy since the 1970s households and communities in canada are becoming smaller have a different form than previous generations and are more socially and economically diverse  while housing costs have increased dramatically in some parts of the country resulting in smaller lot sizes and a growth in multi-family housing options and suburban density
one of the typical critiques of past suburban growth patterns is that they replicate trends of homogenous landscape that are comprised mainly of white middle class nuclear families social diversity and affordability looked to be addressed through creating a different form than this through the design of new communities with place diversity when measured on a scale looking at aspects of complete communities new york city and san francisco rank at the top while atlanta and dallas ranked quite low
defining elements
densification
a benchmark for complete communities is access to services within a five minute walk which contrasts sprawl that is associated with suburbs
diverse housing mix
in canada many municipalities have focused on providing a mix of housing types as the key component of creating a complete community based on directives from provincial and regional policies
diverse land use mix
complete communities involve the densification within existing neighbourhoods to provide services to users and sometimes run contrast to zoning regulations put in place barriers to complete communities include zoning and bylaws that do not promote building with diverse uses and design
employment options
transportation options
as the suburbs grew roadways that prioritized the automobile grew with them especially in the united states widened and expanded metropolitan areas led to poor inner-ring communities with worked to destroy the connection to neighbourhoods institutions parks and town centres planners began to advocate for a community plan where a mix of housing types and uses in compact form would be centred around transportation node for ease of mobility of residents additionally some transportation planners take planning for a connected community one step further by pushing for inclusive multi-modal and equitable transportation systems that work for people of all ages ability income and racial demography
debate critique
although there is a general definition for complete communities the term sometimes is used out of context within many municipal plans the term complete community is used to describe a city mandate without given a description of how the community defines the term this leads to the term to be used for a number of different objectives depending on the goals of the specific community
while many planners look to use urban policy as a way of creating a diverse housing mix some critics argue that it is actually market pressures rather than planners and policy makers who are actually creating the increase in the share of multi-family housing in suburban areas most developers will not actually use the term  complete communities  however many larger master-planning developers will talk about providing a range of housing types as a way of remaining competitive and selling community
