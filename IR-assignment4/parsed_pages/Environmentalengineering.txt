environmental engineering - wikipedia
environmental engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors  protection of environments both local and global from the potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities  and improvement of environmental quality
environmental engineering can also be described as a branch of applied science and technology that addresses the issues of energy preservation production asset and control of waste from human and animal activities furthermore it is concerned with finding plausible solutions in the field of public health such as waterborne diseases implementing laws which promote adequate sanitation in urban rural and recreational areas it involves waste water management air pollution control recycling waste disposal radiation protection industrial hygiene environmental sustainability public health and environmental engineering law it also includes studies on the environmental impact of proposed construction projects
environmental engineers study the effect of technological advances on the environment to do so they conduct studies on hazardous-waste management to evaluate the significance of such hazards advise on treatment and containment and develop regulations to prevent mishaps environmental engineers design municipal water supply and industrial wastewater treatment systems they address local and worldwide environmental issues such as the effects of acid rain global warming ozone depletion water pollution and air pollution from automobile exhausts and industrial sources
at many universities environmental engineering programs are offered at either the department of civil engineering or the department of chemical engineering at engineering faculties environmental  civil  engineers focus on hydrology water resources management bioremediation and water treatment plant design environmental  chemical  engineers on the other hand focus on environmental chemistry advanced air and water treatment technologies and separation processes
additionally engineers are more frequently obtaining specialized training in law  jd  and are utilizing their technical expertise in the practices of environmental engineering law
most jurisdictions also impose licensing and registration requirements



development
ever since people first recognized that their health is related to the quality of their environment they have applied principles to attempt to improve the quality of their environment the ancient indian harappan civilization utilized early sewers in some cities more than 5000 years ago the romans constructed aqueducts to prevent drought and to create a clean healthful water supply for the metropolis of rome in the 15th century bavaria created laws restricting the development and degradation of alpine country that constituted the region s water supply
the field emerged as a separate environmental discipline during the middle third of the 20th century in response to widespread public concern about water and pollution and increasingly extensive environmental quality degradation however its roots extend back to early efforts in public health engineering modern environmental engineering began in london in the mid-19th century when joseph bazalgette designed the first major sewerage system that reduced the incidence of waterborne diseases such as cholera the introduction of drinking water treatment and sewage treatment in industrialized countries reduced waterborne diseases from leading causes of death to rarities
in many cases as societies grew actions that were intended to achieve benefits for those societies had longer-term impacts which reduced other environmental qualities one example is the widespread application of the pesticide ddt to control agricultural pests in the years following world war ii while the agricultural benefits were outstanding and crop yields increased dramatically thus reducing world hunger substantially and malaria was controlled better than it ever had been numerous species were brought to the verge of extinction due to the impact of the ddt on their reproductive cycles the story of ddt as vividly told in rachel carson s silent spring  1962  is considered to be the birth of the modern environmental movement and of the modern field of  environmental engineering 
conservation movements and laws restricting public actions that would harm the environment have been developed by various societies for millennia notable examples are the laws decreeing the construction of sewers in london and paris in the 19th century and the creation of the us national park system in the early 20th century
scope
solid waste management
environmental impact assessment and mitigation
scientists have air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions to some extent this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes they apply scientific and engineering principles to evaluate if there are likely to be any adverse impacts to water quality air quality habitat quality flora and fauna agricultural capacity traffic impacts social impacts ecological impacts noise impacts visual  landscape  impacts etc if impacts are expected they then develop mitigation measures to limit or prevent such impacts an example of a mitigation measure would be the creation of wetlands in a nearby location to mitigate the filling in of wetlands necessary for a road development if it is not possible to reroute the road
in the united states the practice of environmental assessment was formally initiated on january 1 1970 the effective date of the national environmental policy act  nepa  since that time more than 100 developing and developed nations either have planned specific analogous laws or have adopted procedure used elsewhere nepa is applicable to all federal agencies in the united states
water supply and treatment
they evaluate the water balance within a watershed and determine the available water supply the water needed for various needs in that watershed the seasonal cycles of water movement through the watershed and they develop systems to store treat and convey water for various uses water is treated to achieve water quality objectives for the end uses in the case of a potable water supply water is treated to minimize the risk of infectious disease transmission the risk of non-infectious illness and to create a palatable water flavor water distribution systems are designed and built to provide adequate water pressure and flow rates to meet various end-user needs such as domestic use fire suppression and irrigation
wastewater treatment
there are numerous wastewater treatment technologies a wastewater treatment train can consist of a primary clarifier system to remove solid and floating materials a secondary treatment system consisting of an aeration basin followed by flocculation and sedimentation or an activated sludge system and a secondary clarifier a tertiary biological nitrogen removal system and a final disinfection process the aeration basin activated sludge system removes organic material by growing bacteria  activated sludge  the secondary clarifier removes the activated sludge from the water the tertiary system although not always included due to costs is becoming more prevalent to remove nitrogen and phosphorus and to disinfect the water before discharge to a surface water stream or ocean outfall
air pollution management
scientists have developed air pollution dispersion models to evaluate the concentration of a pollutant at a receptor or the impact on overall air quality from vehicle exhausts and industrial flue gas stack emissions to some extent this field overlaps the desire to decrease carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions from combustion processes
environmental protection agency
the us environmental protection agency  epa  is one of the many agencies that work with environmental engineers to solve key issues an important component of epa s mission is to protect and improve air water and overall environmental quality in order to avoid or mitigate the consequences of harmful effects
ecological engineering for sustainable agriculture in arid and semiarid west african regions
ecological engineering offers new alternatives for the management of agricultural systems that are more tailored to the ever-changing social and environmental necessities in these regions this requires managing the complexity of agrosystems while striving to mimic the functioning of natural ecosystems of west african drylands and taking advantage of traditional practices and local know-how resulting from a long process of adaptation to environmental constraints
education
courses aimed at developing graduates with specific skills in environmental systems or environmental technology are becoming more common and fall into broad classes
