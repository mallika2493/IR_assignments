address (geography) - wikipedia
an address is a collection of information presented in a mostly fixed format used to give the location of a building apartment or other structure or a plot of land generally using political boundaries and street names as references along with other identifiers such as house or apartment numbers some addresses also contain special codes such as a post code to aid routing of mail


functions
addresses have several functions 
addresses may have drawbacks 
history
until the advent of modern postal systems around the 18th-19th century most houses and buildings were not numbered streets may have been named for landmarks such as a city gate or market or for the professions of their inhabitants in many cities in asia most minor streets were never named this is still the case today in much of japan a local postman would be familiar with the area and thus able to deliver mail but as postal systems developed it became necessary to number buildings to aid in mail delivery
current addressing schemes
house numbering or naming
in most english-speaking countries the usual method of house numbering is an alternating numbering scheme progressing in one direction along a street with odd numbers on one side  often west or south or the left-hand side leading away from a main road  and even numbers on the other side although there is significant variation on this basic pattern many older towns and cities in the uk have  up and down  numbering where the numbers progress sequentially along one side of the road and then sequentially back down the other side cities in north america particularly those planned on a grid plan often incorporate block numbers quadrants  explained below  and cardinal directions into their street numbers so that in many such cities addresses roughly follow a cartesian coordinate system some other cities around the world have their own schemes
although house numbering is the principal identification scheme in many parts of the world it is also common for houses in the united kingdom and ireland to be identified by name rather than number especially in villages in these cases the street name will usually follow the house name such an address might read   smith cottage frog lane barchester barsetshire bz9 9ba  or  dunroamin emo co laois ireland   fictional examples 
quadrants
in cities with cartesian-coordinate-based addressing systems the streets that form the north-south and east-west dividing lines constitute the x and y axes of a cartesian coordinate plane and thus divide the city into quadrants the quadrants are typically identified in the street names although the manner of doing so varies from city to city for example in one city all streets in the northeast quadrant may have  ne  prefixed or suffixed to their street names while in another the intersection of north calvert street and east 27th street can be only in the northeast quadrant
street-naming conventions
street names may follow a variety of themes in many north american cities such as san francisco usa and edmonton canada streets are simply numbered sequentially across the street grid washington dc has its numbered streets running north-south and lettered or alphabetically named streets running east-west while diagonal avenues are typically named after states in salt lake city and many other utah cities streets are in a large grid and are numbered in increments of 100 based on their location relative to the center of the city in blocks a similar system is in use in detroit with the mile road system in some housing developments in north america and elsewhere street names may all follow the same theme  for example bird species  or start with the same letter streets in continental europe the middle east and latin america are often named after famous people or significant dates
postal codes
postal codes are a relatively recent development in addressing designed to speed the sorting and processing of mail by assigning unique numeric or alphanumeric codes to each geographical locality
postal alternatives to physical addresses
for privacy and other purposes postal services have made it possible to receive mail without revealing one s physical address or even having a fixed physical address examples are post office boxes service addresses and poste restante  general delivery 
address format
in most of the world addresses are written in order from most specific to general ie finest to coarsest information starting with the addressee and ending with the largest geographical unit for example 
in english-speaking countries the postal code usually comes last in much of europe the code precedes the town name thus   1010 lausanne  often the country code is still placed in front of the postal code   ch-1010 lausanne  however this is no longer demanded by postal authorities and has even been forbidden in certain countries
if a house number is provided it is written on the same line as the street name  a house name is written on the previous line when addresses are written inline line breaks are replaced by commas conventions on the placing of house numbers differ  either before or after the street name similarly there are differences in the placement of postal codes  in the uk they are written on a separate line at the end of the address  in australia canada and the united states they usually appear immediately after the state or province on the same line  in austria belgium france germany and the netherlands they appear before the city on the same line
east asian addressing systems including chinese japanese and korean addressing systems when written in their native scripts use the opposite ordering starting with the province prefecture ending with the addressee however both have the same order as western countries when written in the latin alphabet the hungarian system also goes from large to small units except the name of the addressee is put into the first line
the universal postal convention strongly recommends the following 
mailing address format by country
argentina
in argentina an address must be mailed this way 
the postal code has been changed from a four digit format to an eight digit format which is shown in the example the new format adds a district or province letter code at the beginning which allows it to be identified as the system has been changed recently the four digit format can still be used  in that case it is necessary to add the name of the province or district
australia
in common with the rest of the english-speaking world addresses in australia put the street number which may be a range before the street name and the placename before the postcode unlike addresses in most other comparable places the city is not included in the address but rather a much more fine-grained locality is used usually referred to in australia as a suburb or town   although these words are understood in a different way than in other countries because the suburb or town serves to locate the street or delivery type the postcode serves only as routing information rather than to distinguish previous other parts of an address as an example there are around 8000 localities in victoria  cf list of localities in victoria  australia  and list of melbourne suburbs  yet around 700 unique geographic postcodes for certain large volume receivers or post offices the  locality  may be an institution or street name it is always considered incorrect to include the city or metropolis name in an address  unless this happens to be the name of the suburb  and doing so may delay delivery
australia post recommends that the last line of the address should be set in capital letters in australia subunits are essential and should be separated from the street by two spaces  apartments flats and units are typically separated with a forward slash instead as in the us the state territory is crucial information as many placenames are reused in different states territories  it is usually separated from the suburb with two spaces and abbreviated in printed matter the postcode follows after two spaces  in handwritten matter the postcode should be written in the boxes provided
in addition to po boxes other delivery types  which are typically abbreviated  may include

because the dutch postal code uniquely identifies a street a shortened format may also be used this method only needs the postal code and the number the ideal format for this method is the number after the postal code meaning that this   5631 av 1092  will still get the letter delivered to the correct location
