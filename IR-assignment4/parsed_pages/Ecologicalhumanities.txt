ecological humanities - wikipedia
the ecological humanities  also environmental humanities  is an interdisciplinary area of research drawing on the many environmental sub-disciplines that have emerged in the humanities over the past several decades  in particular environmental literature environmental philosophy environmental history and environmental anthropology  the ecological humanities aim to help bridge traditional divides between the sciences and the humanities and between western eastern and indigenous ways of knowing the natural world and the place of humans in it  rose 2004 
the ecological humanities are characterised by a connectivity ontology and a commitment to two fundamental axioms relating to the need to submit to ecological laws and to see humanity as part of a larger living system


connectivity ontology
one of the fundamental ontological presuppositions of ecological humanities is that the organic world and its inorganic parts are seen as a single system whereby each part is linked to each other part this world view in turn shares an intimate connection with lotka s physiological philosophy and the associated concept of the  world engine  when we see everything as connected then the traditional questions of the humanities concerning economic and political justice become enlarged into a consideration of how justice is connected with our transformation of our environment and ecosystems the consequence of such a connectivity ontology is as proponents of the ecological humanities argue that we begin to seek out a more inclusive concept of justice that includes non-humans within the domain of those to whom rights are owing this broadened conception of justice involves  enlarged  or  ecological thinking  which presupposes the enhancement of knowledge sharing within fields of plural and diverse  knowledges  this kind of knowledge sharing is called transdisciplinarity it has links with the political philosophy of hannah arendt and the works of italo calvino as calvino put it  enlarge the sphere of what we can imagine  it also has connections with leibniz s enlightenment project where the sciences are simultaneously abridged while also being enlarged
the situation is complicated however by the recognition of the fact that connections are both non-linear and linear the ecological humanities therefore require both linear and non-linear modes of language through which reasoning about justice can be done thus there is a motivation to find linguistic modes which can adequately express both linear and non-linear connectivities
axioms of ecological humanities
there are three axioms of ecological humanities  
putting the first and second axioms another way the connections between and among living things are the basis for how ecosystems are understood to work and thus constitute laws of existence and guidelines for behaviour  rose 2004 
the first of these axioms has a tradition in social sciences  see marx 1968  3  from the second axiom the notions of  ecological embodiment  embededness  and  habitat  have emerged from political theory with a fundamental connectivity to rights democracy and ecologism  eckersley 1996  222 225  eckersley 1998 
the third axiom comes from the strong  self-reflective  tradition of all  humanities  scholarship and it encourages ecological humanities to investigate its own theoretical basis  and without which ecological humanities is just  ecology  
contemporary ideas
political economic ecology
some theorists have suggested that the inclusion of non-humans in the consideration of justice links ecocentric philosophy with political economics this is because the theorising of justice is a central activity of political economic philosophy if in accordance with the axioms of ecological humanities theories of justice are enlarged to include ecological values then the necessary result is the synthesis of the concerns of ecology with that of political economy  ie political economic ecology
energy systems language
the question of what language can best depict the linear and non-linear causal connections of ecological systems appears to have been taken up by the school of ecology known as systems ecology to depict the linear and non-linear internal relatedness of ecosystems where the laws of thermodynamics hold significant consequences  hannon et al 1991  80  systems ecologist ht odum  1994  predicated the energy systems language on the principles of ecological energetics in ecological energetics just as in ecological humanities the causal bond between connections is considered an ontic category  see patten et al 1976  460  moreover as a result of simulating ecological systems with the energy systems language htodum make the controversial suggestion that embodied energy could be understood as value which in itself is a step into the field of political economic ecology noted above
