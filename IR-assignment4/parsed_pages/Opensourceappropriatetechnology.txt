open-source-appropriate technology - wikipedia
open-source-appropriate technology  osat  refers to appropriate technology designed in the same fashion as free and open-source software osat refers to on the one hand technology designed with special consideration to the environmental ethical cultural social political and economic aspects of the community it is intended for on the other hand osat is developed in the open and licensed in such a way as to allow their designs to be used modified and distributed freely


benefits
open source is a development method for appropriate technology that harnesses the power of distributed peer review and transparency of process appropedia is an example of open-source appropriate technology there anyone can both learn how to make and use at free of concerns about patents at the same time anyone can also add to the collective open-source knowledge base by contributing ideas observations experimental data deployment logs etc it has been claimed that the potential for open-source-appropriate technology to drive applied sustainability is enormous the built in continuous peer-review can result in better quality higher reliability and more flexibility than conventional design patenting of technologies the free nature of the knowledge also obviously provides lower costs particularly for those technologies that do not benefit to a large degree from scale of manufacture finally osat also enables the end to predatory intellectual property lock-in this is particularly important in the context of technology focused on relieving suffering and saving lives in the developing world
the  open-source  model can act as a driver of sustainable development there are  at least  three good reasons 
ethical considerations
for solutions many researchers companies and academics do work on products meant to assist sustainable development vinay gupta has suggested that those developers agree to three principles 
the ethics of information sharing in this context has been explored in depth
support in the literature
in education
open source scientific equipment
evaluation
appropriate technology is designed to promote decentralized labor-intensive energy-efficient and environmentally sound businesses carroll pursell says that the movement declined from 1965 to 1985 due to an inability to counter advocates of agribusiness large private utilities and multinational construction companies recently  2011  several barriers to osat deployment have been identified
