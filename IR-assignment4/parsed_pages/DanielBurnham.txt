early life
burnham was born in henderson new york and raised in chicago illinois his parents brought him up under the teachings of the swedenborgian called the new church which ingrained in him the strong belief that man should strive to be of service to others
after failing admissions tests for both harvard and yale angel and an unsuccessful stint at politics burnham apprenticed as a draftsman under william lebaron jenney
career
at age 26 burnham moved on to the chicago offices of carter drake and wight where he met future business partner john wellborn root  1850 1891 
burnham and root were the architects of one of the first american skyscrapers  the masonic temple building in chicago measuring 21 stories and 302 feet the temple held claims as the tallest building of its time but was torn down in 1939 under the design influence of root the firm had produced modern buildings as part of the chicago school following root s premature death from pneumonia in 1891 the firm became known as dh burnham   company
world s columbian exposition
burnham and root had accepted responsibility to oversee design and construction of the world s columbian exposition in chicago s then-desolate jackson park on the south lakefront the largest world s fair to that date  1893  it celebrated the 400-year anniversary of christopher columbus  famous voyage after root s sudden and unexpected death a team of distinguished american architects and landscape architects including burnham frederick law olmsted charles mckim and louis sullivan radically changed root s modern and colorful style to a classical revival style under burnham s direction the construction of the fair overcame huge financial and logistical hurdles including a worldwide financial panic and an extremely tight timeframe to open on time
considered the first example of a comprehensive planning document in the nation the fairground was complete with grand boulevards classical building facades and lush gardens often called the  white city  it popularized neoclassical architecture in a monumental and rational beaux-arts plan the remaining population of architects in the us were soon asked by clients to incorporate similar elements into their designs
city planning and  the plan of chicago 
initiated in 1906 and published in 1909 burnham and his co-author edward h bennett prepared  the plan of chicago  which laid out plans for the future of the city it was the first comprehensive plan for the controlled growth of an american city and an outgrowth of the city beautiful movement the plan included ambitious proposals for the lakefront and river and declared that every citizen should be within walking distance of a park sponsored by the commercial club of chicago burnham donated his services in hopes of furthering his own cause
plans and conceptual designs of the south lakefront from the exposition came in handy as he envisioned chicago being a  paris on the prairie  french-inspired public works constructions fountains and boulevards radiating from a central domed municipal palace became chicago s new backdrop though only parts of the plan were actually implemented it set the standard for urban design anticipating future need to control unexpected urban growth and continued to influence the development of chicago long after burnham s death
city planning projects did not stop at chicago though burnham contributed to plans for cities such as cleveland  the group plan  san francisco and manila and baguio in the philippines details of which appear in  the chicago plan  publication of 1909 his plans for the redesign of san francisco were delivered to city hall on april 17 1906 the day before the 1906 earthquake in the haste to rebuild the city the plans were ultimately ignored the plan for manila never fully materialized due to the breaking out of world war ii and relocating the capital to another city after the war components of the plan which came into fruition include the shore road which became dewey boulevard  now known as roxas boulevard  and various neo-classical government buildings around luneta park which very much resembles a mini version of washington dc
in washington dc burnham did much to shape the 1901 mcmillan plan which led to the completion of the overall design of the national mall the senate park commission or mcmillan commission established by michigan senator james mcmillan brought together burnham and three of his colleagues from the world s columbian exposition architect charles follen mckim landscape architect frederick law olmsted jr and sculptor augustus saint-gaudens going well beyond pierre l enfant s original vision for the city the plan provided for the extension of the mall beyond the washington monument to a new lincoln memorial and a  pantheon  that eventually materialized as the jefferson memorial this plan involved significant reclamation of land from swamp and the potomac river and the relocation of an existing railroad station on the site which was replaced by burnham s own design for union station as a result of his service on the mcmillan commission in 1910 burnham was appointed a member and the first chairman of the united states commission of fine arts helping to assure the implementation of the mcmillann plan s vision burnham served on the commission until his death in 1912
influence
much of his work was based on the classical style of greece and rome in his 1924 autobiography louis sullivan one of the leading architects from the chicago school but one who had enjoyed difficult relations with burnham over an extended period of time criticised burnham for what sullivan viewed as his lack of original expression and dependence on classicism sullivan went on to claim that  the damage wrought by the world s fair will last for half a century from its date if not longer  a sentiment edged with bitterness as corporate america of the early 20th century had demonstrated a strong preference for burnham s architectural style over sullivan s
burnham is famously quoted as saying  make no little plans they have no magic to stir men s blood and probably will not themselves be realized  this slogan has been taken to capture the essence of burnham s spirit
a man of influence burnham was considered the preeminent architect in america at the start of the 20th century he held many positions during his lifetime including the presidency of the american institute of architects other notable architects began their careers under his aegis such as joseph w mccarthy
death
in 1912 when he died in heidelberg germany dh burnham and co was the world s largest architectural firm even legendary architect frank lloyd wright although strongly critical of burnham s beaux arts european influences still admired him as a man eulogized    burnham  made masterful use of the methods and men of his time  as  an enthusiastic promoter of great construction enterprises his powerful personality was supreme  the successor firm to burnham s practice was graham anderson probst   white which continued in some form until 2006 burnham was buried in graceland cemetery in chicago
