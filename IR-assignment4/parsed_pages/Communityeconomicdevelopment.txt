history
economic development has existed even at a basic level since the earliest recorded communities however in the us and several other countries the concept of community economic development emerged  in response to tenacious poverty and the need for affordable housing good jobs affordable health care and quality of life matters needed for human existence 
ced in the us
in the late 19th century reformers discovered less than desirable areas of the country where communities were overcrowded unhealthy poor and centered near factories docks and various other places of employment in the early twentieth century during the progressive era reformers began making connections between the condition of communities and  social ills  such as crime and poverty and ways to improve upon them the progressive agenda of political social and physical reform swept the nation and led to comprehensive antipoverty strategies embodied by new deal programs and other grants in the 1930s policies during this time were top-down and citizens being affected had very little input to the changes being made once communities began to be revitalized segregation policy followed to determine who was allowed to live where housing policy and real estate practices stifled upward mobility for non-whites and their communities developed with unique characteristics and problems as a result these actions shaped communities until the 1960s when president lbj signed into law many anti-discriminatory laws such as the civil rights act of 1964 and also declared a war on poverty which brought renewal and upward mobility for many people more loan programs grants and fair housing policies were implemented throughout the 60 s and 70 s but still failed to be non-discriminatory on the basis of race in some cases thus shaping communities in a particular fashion social investment gained momentum once again in the 80 s and 90 s bringing change to communities across america municipal governments become more representative of the communities they serve and the public is more involved and can interact with bureaucracies and elected officials with greater ease many initiatives existed at this time to renew inner cities and rural areas while also tackling social issues such as eradicating drugs and improving education the modern day ced movement is focused on renewing urban and rural communities social justice is a key component to policy and conversation about changes to be made citizens are engaged with bureaucracies and their elected officials through a variety of mediums such as social media input from the people has gained more value due to increased demands for transparency
ced around the world

in asia for the last 60 years the asian foundation has supported asian initiatives to foster inclusive economic growth and broaden economic opportunitiesthe foundation designs and implements economic programs in three core areas business environments for private sector growth entrepreneurship development and regional economic cooperation
theories and strategies
the most significant aspect of community economic development aside from the fact that it focuses on economic development in specific localities is that focuses on the process of community building this  community  aspect of ced assumes that the community will play a dynamic role in economic development processes and that community development will contribute to sustained economic development and vice versa in this understanding the community is considered both as an input and output in this ced equation
looking at ced from an economic viewpoint the initial purpose of such an approach is the creation of local jobs and the stimulation of business activity integrally linked to these purposes are strategies to increase access to capital stimulate asset building improve the general business climate and link citywide economic development efforts to specific community development efforts
increasing access to capital is an extremely important strategy for community economic development historically residents in poor neighborhoods have experienced great difficulty finding access to capital because they are traditionally viewed as credit risks in places where banks do offer services these residents face other structural barriers such as minimum deposit requirements high service fees and complex paperwork to solve these problems a community economic development approach would develop alternate neighborhood community development financial institutions such as community development credit unions community development banks and community development venture capital funds
improving the general business climate is also integral to community economic development strategies to do so would include improving the infrastructure and physical appearance of commercial areas the quality of quantity of residential housing and the transportation systems in a neighborhood while these may not directly economic activities they serve to strengthen the economic well being of an area because it encourages businesses to locate there
objectives and goals
community economic development exists in all developed countries but varies in the way it functions with the different systems of governments around the world research makes it apparent that there are common goals and objectives such as economic activities and programs that develop low-income communities community development corporations reformers and other agencies have other common initiatives including services to fight homelessness lack of jobs drug abuse violence and crime as well as quality medical and childcare and home ownership opportunities while also bringing economic prosperity another increasingly common objective is to preserve the character of communities and strong support for local business
countries across the globe participate in reinvestment and development through a bank such as the community reinvestment act world bank and the ida amongst many others another commonality for nations international is need to incorporate sustainability and the natural environment into the growth of societies
policies
economic policies of central governments often do not appear to help economies on a local level large free market economies tend to take more out of local communities than they put back into them leaving economic dead zones within these communities community economic development policy argues that it is in the social interest of a local economy to be at least partially owned by the community the locality is responsible for initially coming up with the visions for their economic future  community economic development assists with expanding access to capital and stimulating asset accumulation increasing local access to consumer goods and services expanding the local entrepreneurial base expanding local employment opportunities  giving neighborhoods more control over ownership of local resources and connecting residents and businesses to the regional economy
implementation
several communities across the united states have successfully crafted policy to create groups and corporations to assist in multiple facets of the communities economy and welfare the following organizations are examples of community economic development initiatives
the western australian government department of commerce and trade had an active community economic development branch working within regional development during the 1990s they ran programs in small town economic planning  step  program in which local communities were asked to bring together a cross section of influential groups representative of the community for a one- or two-day community planning event after which they were given a grant of up to  15,000 for the implementation of initiatives identified for a considerable number of the state s 158 local government councils they also ran a community auditing initiative and with the office of the minister of agriculture ran a community development program training local people in the skills of community economic development the reorganisation of the department in 2002 saw the name changed to community capacity building and the department itself was reorganised as the department of regional development and local government until 2007 after which the community capacity building branch was disbanded
in brazil the banco palmas has established community economic development initiatives through the use and development of a community currency the community has prospered and has been widely adopted so that by 2011 there were 43 community banks within the country using the banco palmas model the brazilian government has since encouraged the movement and in 2015 there were more than 100 initiatives in various parts of the country
obstacles
in the us community economic development projects are often funded by commercial banks within the structure of the community reinvestment act this act of congress took effect in november 1978 it is administered by banks and other financial institutions and has been instrumental in helping the owners of smaller businesses navigate the steps of obtaining loans for development projects a bank will operate a separate division within their loan department that focuses its expertise on small business services as well as training and education because projects brought to cra bank departments are often from areas of lower economic standing and or unproven consumer markets they are a larger risk to lenders this heavier risk brings more stringent underwriting guidelines in addition to often rigid government requirements many financial institutions state that these rules are cumbersome and difficult to comply with
