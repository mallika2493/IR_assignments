marine spatial planning - wikipedia
marine spatial planning  msp  is a process that brings together multiple users of the ocean   including energy industry government conservation and recreation   to make informed and coordinated decisions about how to use marine resources sustainably msp generally uses maps to create a more comprehensive picture of a marine area   identifying where and how an ocean area is being used and what natural resources and habitat exist it is similar to land-use planning but for marine waters
through the planning and mapping process of a marine ecosystem planners can consider the cumulative effect of maritime industries on our seas seek to make industries more sustainable and proactively minimize conflicts between industries seeking to utilise the same sea area the intended result of msp is a more coordinated and sustainable approach to how our oceans are used   ensuring that marine resources and services are utilized but within clear environmental limits to ensure marine ecosystems remain healthy and biodiversity is conserved


definition and concept
there are a number of definitions for marine spatial planning according to the united nations educational scientific and cultural organization marine spatial planning is a public process of analyzing and allocating the spatial and temporal distribution of human activities in marine areas to achieve ecological economic and social objectives that usually have been specified through a political process essentially marine spatial planning is a planning tool that enables integrated forward-looking and consistent decision-making on the use of the sea numerous countries around the globe are embracing this tool to combat crowded usage of their territorial sea waters
the united kingdom s department of environment food and rural affairs has developed a commonly used definition 
the main elements of marine spatial planning include an interlinked system of plans policies and regulations  the components of environmental management systems  eg setting objectives initial assessment implementation monitoring audit and review   and some of the many tools that are already used for land use planning whatever the building blocks the essential consideration is that they need to work across sectors and give a geographic context in which to make decisions about the use of resources development conservation and the management of activities in the marine environment  jmpmu 55 2007 
effective marine spatial planning has essential attributes 
marine spatial planning in the united kingdom
the marine and coastal access act 2009  defined arrangements for a new system of marine management including the introduction of marine spatial planning across the uk although the new system comprises the principles of marine spatial planning as articulated by the european commission it is commonly referred to in the uk simply as  marine planning 
among the government s stated aims for the new marine planning system is to ensure that coastal areas the activities within them and the problems they face are managed in an integrated and holistic way this will require close interaction with town and country planning regimes and in england and wales the new regime for nationally significant infrastructure projects  nsips  in key sectors such as energy and transport
the marine policy statement
the cornerstone of the uk marine planning system is the marine policy statement  mps  it sets out the sectoral activity specific policy objectives that the uk government scottish government welsh assembly government and northern ireland executive are seeking to achieve in the marine area in securing the uk vision of  clean healthy safe productive and biologically diverse oceans and seas 
the mps is the framework for preparing marine plans and taking decisions that affect the marine environment in england scotland wales and northern ireland it will also set the direction for new marine licensing and other authorisation systems in each administration it is proposed that the draft mps which was subject to consultation in 2010 will be formally adopted as government policy in 2011
the marine management organisation
in england the new arrangements provide for the creation of the marine management organisation  mmo  which started work in april 2010 the mmo will deliver uk marine policy objectives for english waters through a series of statutory marine plans and other measures the first marine plans will start to be prepared by the mmo on adoption of the mps in 2011 the uk government s consultation on a marine planning system for england  document provides for the benefit of the mmo and other interested parties more detail on the scope structure content and process envisaged for each marine plan
marine scotland  scottish government 
marine scotland is the government authority which will implement marine planning in scottish waters under the marine  scotland  act a pre-consultation national marine plan was prepared in 2011 and the final plan was released in march 2015
marine spatial planning in the united states
on june 12 2009 president obama created an interagency ocean policy task force to provide recommendations on ocean policy including msp
some individual states have already undertaken msp initiatives 
massachusetts
the massachusetts ocean act enacted in may 2008 requires the secretary of the massachusetts office of energy and environmental affairs to develop a comprehensive ocean management plan the plan will be submitted to noaa for incorporation into the existing coastal zone management plan and enforced through the state s regulatory and permitting processes including the massachusetts environmental policy act  mepa  and chapter 91 the state s waterways law
the goal is to institute a comprehensive approach to ocean resource management that supports ecosystem health and economic vitality balances current ocean uses and considers future needs this will be accomplished by determining where specific ocean uses will be permitted and which ocean uses are compatible
rhode island
the rhode island ocean special area management plan or ocean samp serves as a federally recognized coastal management and regulatory tool it was adopted by the coastal resource management council  crmc the state s coastal management agency on october 19 2010 the ocean samp was then adopted by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration  noaa  on may 11 2011 using the best available science the ocean samp provides a balanced approach to the development and protection of rhode island s ocean-based resources
research projects undertaken by university of rhode island  uri  scientists provide the essential scientific basis for ocean samp policy development the ocean samp document underwent an extensive public review process prior to adoption

california
in 1999 the california state legislature adopted the marine life protection act this action required the state to evaluate and possibly redesign all existing state marine protected areas and to potentially create new protected areas that could to the greatest degree possible act as a networked system  marine protected area designations in california include state marine reserves marine parks and marine conservation areas  this effort does not meet the full definition of marine spatial planning since its goal was to cite only protected areas rather than all potential ocean uses but many of its elements  such as stakeholder involvement and mapping approaches  will be of interest to marine spatial planners
oregon
two controversial ocean issues led to a marine spatial planning effort  concern by fishermen over the designation of marine reserves off the oregon coast and proposals by industry to site wave energy facilities in oregon ocean waters
an executive order directed the oregon department of land conservation and development to work with stakeholders and scientists to prepare a plan for ocean energy development  also known as wave energy  this plan was then to be adopted as part of the oregon territorial sea plan
the state has appointed an advisory committee and expects to adopt the plan in early 2010 it will include mandatory policies for state and federal agency decisions with regard to locating ocean energy facilities in the oregon territorial sea
washington
in march 2010 the washington state legislature enacted the marine waters planning and management act to address resource use conflicts a report to the legislature providing guidance and recommendations for moving forward was produced in 2011 and based on the 2012 report the legislature authorized funds to begin the msp process off of washington s coast
a state law required an interagency team to provide recommendations to the washington state legislature about how to effectively use marine spatial planning and integrate msp into existing state management plans and authorities the team is chaired by the governor s office and coordinated by the department of ecology other members include the washington department of natural resources washington sea grant the washington department of fish and wildlife and washington state parks and recreation commission
evaluation of spatially managed marine areas
to evaluate how well a marine spatial plan performs the eu fp7 project mesma  2009-2013  has developed a step-wise evaluation approach this framework provides guidance on the selection mapping and assessment of ecosystem components and human pressures it also addresses the evaluation of management effectiveness and potential adaptations to management moreover it provides advice on the use of spatially explicit tools for practical tasks like the assessment of cumulative impacts of human pressures or pressure-state relationships governance is directly linked to the framework through a governance analysis that can be performed in parallel and feeds into the different steps of the framework to help managers mesma has developed a tools portal
tools
there are a number of useful and innovative tools that can help managers implement marine spatial planning some include
