water scarcity - wikipedia
water scarcity is the lack of sufficient available water resources to meet water needs within a region it affects every continent and around 2.8 billion people around the world at least one month out of every year more than 1.2 billion people lack access to clean drinking water
water scarcity involves water shortage water stress or deficits and water crisis the relatively new concept of water stress is difficulty in obtaining sources of fresh water for use during a period of time  it may result in further depletion and deterioration of available water resources water shortages may be caused by climate change such as altered weather-patterns  including droughts or floods  increased pollution and increased human demand and overuse of water the term water crisis labels a situation where the available potable unpolluted water within a region is less than that region s demand two converging phenomena drive water scarcity  growing freshwater use and depletion of usable freshwater resources
water scarcity can result from two mechanisms 
physical water scarcity results from inadequate natural water resources to supply a region s demand and economic water scarcity results from poor management of the sufficient available water resources according to the united nations development programme the latter is found more often to be the cause of countries or regions experiencing water scarcity as most countries or regions have enough water to meet household industrial agricultural and environmental needs but lack the means to provide it in an accessible manner
many countries and governments aim to reduce water scarcity the un recognizes the importance of reducing the number of people without sustainable access to clean water and sanitation the millennium development goals within the united nations millennium declaration aimed by 2015 to  halve the proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford safe drinking water 


water stress
the united nations  un  estimates that of 1.4 billion cubic kilometers  1 quadrillion acre-feet  of water on earth just 200,000 cubic kilometers  162.1 billion acre-feet  represent fresh water available for human consumption
more than one in every six people in the world is water stressed meaning that they do not have access to potable water those that are water stressed make up 1.1 billion people in the world and are living in developing countries according to the falkenmark water stress indicator a country or region is said to experience  water stress  when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year at levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic meters per person per year periodic or limited water shortages can be expected when a country is below 1,000 cubic meters per person per year the country then faces water scarcity  in 2006 about 700 million people in 43 countries were living below the 1,700 cubic metres per person threshold water stress is ever intensifying in regions such as china india and sub-saharan africa which contains the largest number of water stressed countries of any region with almost one fourth of the population living in a water stressed country the world s most water stressed region is the middle east with averages of 1,200 cubic metres of water per person in china more than 538 million people are living in a water-stressed region much of the water stressed population currently live in river basins where the usage of water resources greatly exceed the renewal of the water source
changes in climate
another popular opinion is that the amount of available freshwater is decreasing because of climate change climate change has caused receding glaciers reduced stream and river flow and shrinking lakes and ponds many aquifers have been over-pumped and are not recharging quickly although the total fresh water supply is not used up much has become polluted salted unsuitable or otherwise unavailable for drinking industry and agriculture to avoid a global water crisis farmers will have to strive to increase productivity to meet growing demands for food while industry and cities find ways to use water more efficiently
a new york times article  southeast drought study ties water shortage to population not global warming  summarizes the findings of columbia university researcher on the subject of the droughts in the american southeast between 2005 and 2007 the findings published in the journal of climate say that the water shortages resulted from population size more than rainfall census figures show that georgia s population rose from 6.48 to 9.54 million between 1990 and 2007 after studying data from weather instruments computer models and tree ring measurements they found that the droughts were not unprecedented and result from normal climate patterns and random weather events  similar droughts unfolded over the last thousand years  the researchers wrote  regardless of climate change they added similar weather patterns can be expected regularly in the future with similar results  as the temperature increases rainfall in the southeast will increase but because of evaporation the area may get even drier the researchers concluded with a statement saying that any rainfall comes from complicated internal processes in the atmosphere and are very hard to predict because of the large amount of variables
water crisis
when there is not enough potable water for a given population the threat of a water crisis is realized the united nations and other world organizations consider a variety of regions to have water crises of global concern other organizations such as the food and agriculture organization argue that there are no water crises in such places but steps must still be taken to avoid one
effects of water crisis
there are several principal manifestations of the water crisis
waterborne diseases caused by lack of sanitation and hygiene are one of the leading causes of death worldwide for children under age five waterborne diseases are a leading cause of death according to the world bank 88 percent of all waterborne diseases are caused by unsafe drinking water inadequate sanitation and poor hygiene
water is the underlying tenuous balance of safe water supply but controllable factors such as the management and distribution of the water supply itself contribute to further scarcity
a 2006 united nations report focuses on issues of governance as the core of the water crisis saying  there is enough water for everyone  and  water insufficiency is often due to mismanagement corruption lack of appropriate institutions bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of investment in both human capacity and physical infrastructure  official data also shows a clear correlation between access to safe water and gdp per capita
it has also been claimed primarily by economists that the water situation has occurred because of a lack of property rights government regulations and subsidies in the water sector causing prices to be too low and consumption too high
vegetation and wildlife are fundamentally dependent upon adequate freshwater resources marshes bogs and riparian zones are more obviously dependent upon sustainable water supply but forests and other upland ecosystems are equally at risk of significant productivity changes as water availability is diminished in the case of wetlands considerable area has been simply taken from wildlife use to feed and house the expanding human population but other areas have suffered reduced productivity from gradual diminishing of freshwater inflow as upstream sources are diverted for human use in seven states of the us over 80 percent of all historic wetlands were filled by the 1980s when congress acted to create a  no net loss  of wetlands
in europe extensive loss of wetlands has also occurred with resulting loss of biodiversity for example many bogs in scotland have been developed or diminished through human population expansion one example is the portlethen moss in aberdeenshire
on madagascar s highland plateau a massive transformation occurred that eliminated virtually all the heavily forested vegetation in the period 1970 to 2000 the slash and burn agriculture eliminated about ten percent of the total country s native biomass and converted it to a barren wasteland these effects were from overpopulation and the necessity to feed poor indigenous peoples but the adverse effects included widespread gully erosion that in turn produced heavily silted rivers that  run red  decades after the deforestation this eliminated a large amount of usable fresh water and also destroyed much of the riverine ecosystems of several large west-flowing rivers several fish species have been driven to the edge of extinction and some such as the disturbed tokios coral reef formations in the indian ocean are effectively lost in october 2008 peter brabeck-letmathe chairman and former chief executive of nestl  warned that the production of biofuels will further deplete the world s water supply
overview of regions suffering crisis impacts
there are many other countries of the world that are severely impacted with regard to human health and inadequate drinking water the following is a partial list of some of the countries with significant populations  numerical population of affected population listed  whose only consumption is of contaminated water 
several world maps showing various aspects of the problem can be found in this graph article
according to the california department of resources if more supplies aren t found by 2020 the region will face a shortfall nearly as great as the amount consumed today los angeles is a coastal desert able to support at most 1 million people on its own water  the los angeles basin now is the core of a megacity that spans 220 miles  350 km  from santa barbara to the mexican border the region s population is expected to reach 41 million by 2020 up from 28 million in 2009 the population of california continues to grow by more than two million a year and is expected to reach 75 million in 2030 up from 49 million in 2009 but water shortage is likely to surface well before then
water deficits which are already spurring heavy grain imports in numerous smaller countries may soon do the same in larger countries such as china and india the water tables are falling in scores of countries  including northern china the us and india  due to widespread overpumping using powerful diesel and electric pumps other countries affected include pakistan iran and mexico this will eventually lead to water scarcity and cutbacks in grain harvest even with the overpumping of its aquifers china is developing a grain deficit when this happens it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward most of the 3 billion people projected to be added worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing water shortages unless population growth can be slowed quickly it is feared that there may not be a practical non-violent or humane solution to the emerging world water shortage
after china and india there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits   algeria egypt iran mexico and pakistan four of these already import a large share of their grain but with a population expanding by 4 million a year they will also likely soon turn to the world market for grain
according to a un climate report the himalayan glaciers that are the sources of asia s biggest rivers   ganges indus brahmaputra yangtze mekong salween and yellow   could disappear by 2035 as temperatures rise it was later revealed that the source used by the un climate report actually stated 2350 not 2035 approximately 2.4 billion people live in the drainage basin of the himalayan rivers india china pakistan bangladesh nepal and myanmar could experience floods followed by droughts in coming decades in india alone the ganges provides water for drinking and farming for more than 500 million people the west coast of north america which gets much of its water from glaciers in mountain ranges such as the rocky mountains and sierra nevada also would be affected
by far the largest part of australia is desert or semi-arid lands commonly known as the outback in june 2008 it became known that an expert panel had warned of long term possibly irreversible severe ecological damage for the whole murray-darling basin if it does not receive sufficient water by october water restrictions are currently in place in many regions and cities of australia in response to chronic shortages resulting from drought the australian of the year 2007 environmentalist tim flannery predicted that unless it made drastic changes perth in western australia could become the world s first ghost metropolis an abandoned city with no more water to sustain its population however western australia s dams reached 50  capacity for the first time since 2000 as of september 2009 as a result heavy rains have brought forth positive results for the region nonetheless the following year 2010 perth suffered its second-driest winter on record and the water corporation tightened water restrictions for spring
physical and economic scarcity
around one fifth of the world s population currently live in regions affected by physical water scarcity where there is inadequate water resources to meet a country s or regional demand including the water needed to fulfill the demand of ecosystems to function effectively arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity it also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed such as when there is over development of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater as well as other forms of exploitation or overuse
economic water scarcity is caused by a lack of investment in infrastructure or technology to draw water from rivers aquifers or other water sources or insufficient human capacity to satisfy the demand for water one quarter of the world s population is affected by economic water scarcity economic water scarcity includes a lack of infrastructure causing the people without reliable access to water to have to travel long distances to fetch water that is often contaminated from rivers for domestic and agricultural uses large parts of africa suffer from economic water scarcity  developing water infrastructure in those areas could therefore help to reduce poverty critical conditions often arise for economically poor and politically weak communities living in already dry environment consumption increases with gdp per capita in most developed countries the average amount is around 200-300 litres daily in underdeveloped  eg african countries such as mozambique average daily water consumption per capita was below 10 l this is against the backdrop of international organisations which recommend a minimum of 20 l of water  not including the water needed for washing clothes  available at most 1 km from the household increased water consumption is correlated with increasing income as measured by gdp per capita in countries suffering from water shortages water is the subject of speculation
human right to water
the united nations committee on economic social and cultural rights established a foundation of five core attributes for water security they declare that the human right to water entitles everyone to sufficient safe acceptable physically accessible and affordable water for personal and domestic use
millennium development goals  mdg 
at the 2000 millennium summit the united nations addressed the effects of economic water scarcity by making increased access to safe drinking water an international development goal during this time they drafted the millennium development goals and all 189 un members agreed on eight goals mdg 7 sets a target for reducing the proportion of the population without sustainable safe drinking water access by half by 2015 this would mean that more than 600 million people would gain access to a safe source of drinking water in 2016 the sustainable development goals replace the millennium development goals
water scarcity s effects on environment
water scarcity has many negative impacts on the environment including lakes rivers wetlands and other fresh water resources the resulting water overuse that is related to water scarcity often located in areas of irrigation agriculture harms the environment in several ways including increased salinity nutrient pollution and the loss of floodplains and wetlands furthermore water scarcity makes flow management in the rehabilitation of urban streams problematic
through the last hundred years more than half of the earth s wetlands have been destroyed and have disappeared these wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals birds fish amphibians and invertebrates but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding freshwater lakes such as the aral sea in central asia have also suffered once the fourth largest freshwater lake it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades
subsidence or the gradual sinking of landforms is another result of water scarcity the us geological survey estimates that subsidence has affected more than 17,000 square miles in 45 us states 80 percent of it due to groundwater usage in some areas east of houston texas the land has dropped by more than nine feet due to subsidence brownwood a subdivision near baytown texas was abandoned due to frequent flooding caused by subsidence and has since become part of the baytown nature center
climate change
aquifer drawdown or overdrafting and the pumping of fossil water increases the total amount of water within the hydrosphere subject to transpiration and evaporation processes thereby causing accretion in water vapour and cloud cover the primary absorbers of infrared radiation in the earth s atmosphere adding water to the system has a forcing effect on the whole earth system an accurate estimate of which hydrogeological fact is yet to be quantified
depletion of freshwater resources
apart from the conventional surface water sources of freshwater such as rivers and lakes other resources of freshwater such as groundwater and glaciers have become more developed sources of freshwater becoming the main source of clean water groundwater is water that has pooled below the surface of the earth and can provide a usable quantity of water through springs or wells these areas where groundwater is collected are also known as aquifers glaciers provide freshwater in the form meltwater or freshwater melted from snow or ice that supply streams or springs as temperatures rise more and more of these sources are being drawn upon as conventional sources  usability decreases due to factors such as pollution or disappearance due to climate changes the exponential growth rate of the human population is a main contributing factor in the increasing use of these types of water resources
groundwater
until recent history groundwater was not a highly utilized resource in the 1960s more and more groundwater aquifers developed changes in knowledge technology and funding have allowed for focused development into abstracting water from groundwater resources away from surface water resources these changes allowed for progress in society such as the  agricultural groundwater revolution  expanding the irrigation sector allowing for increased food production and development in rural areas groundwater supplies nearly half of all drinking water in the world the large volumes of water stored underground in most aquifers have a considerable buffer capacity allowing for water to be withdrawn during periods of drought or little rainfall this is crucial for people that live in regions that cannot depend on precipitation or surface water as a supply alone instead providing reliable access to water all year round as of 2010 the world s aggregated groundwater abstraction is estimated at approximately 1,000 km3 per year with 67  used for irrigation 22  used for domestic purposes and 11  used for industrial purposes the top ten major consumers of abstracted water  india china united states of america pakistan iran bangladesh mexico saudi arabia indonesia and italy  make up 72  of all abstracted water use worldwide groundwater has become crucial for the livelihoods and food security of 1.2 to 1.5 billion rural households in the poorer regions of africa and asia
although groundwater sources are quite prevalent one major area of concern is the renewal rate or recharge rate of some groundwater sources abstracting from groundwater sources that are non-renewable could lead to exhaustion if not properly monitored and managed another concern of increased groundwater usage is the diminished water quality of the source over time reduction of natural outflows decreasing stored volumes declining water levels and water degradation are commonly observed in groundwater systems groundwater depletion may result in many negative effects such as increased cost of groundwater pumping induced salinity and other water quality changes land subsidence degraded springs and reduced baseflows human pollution is also harmful to this important resource
glaciers
glaciers are noted as a vital water source due to their contribution to stream flow rising global temperatures have noticeable effects on the rate at which glaciers melt causing glaciers in general to shrink worldwide although the meltwater from these glaciers are increasing the total water supply for the present the disappearance of glaciers in the long term will diminish available water resources increased meltwater due to rising global temperatures can also have negative effects such as flooding of lakes and dams and catastrophic results
measurement of water scarcity
hydrologists today typically assess water scarcity by looking at the population-water equation this is done by comparing the amount of total available water resources per year to the population of a country or region a popular approach to measuring water scarcity has been to rank countries according to the amount of annual water resources available per person for example according to the falkenmark water stress indicator a country or region is said to experience  water stress  when annual water supplies drop below 1,700 cubic metres per person per year at levels between 1,700 and 1,000 cubic metres per person per year periodic or limited water shortages can be expected when water supplies drop below 1,000 cubic metres per person per year the country faces  water scarcity  the united nations  fao states that by 2025 1.9 billion people will live in countries or regions with absolute water scarcity and two-thirds of the world population could be under stress conditions the world bank adds that climate change could profoundly alter future patterns of both water availability and usethereby increasing levels of water stress and insecurity both at the global scale and in sectors that depend on water
other ways of measuring water scarcity include examining the physical existence of water in nature comparing nations with lower or higher volumes of water available for use this method often fails to capture the accessibility of the water resource to the population that may need it others have related water availability to population
another measurement calculated as part of a wider assessment of water management in 2007 aimed to relate water availability to how the resource was actually used it therefore divided water scarcity into  physical  and  economic  physical water scarcity is where there is not enough water to meet all demands including that needed for ecosystems to function effectively arid regions frequently suffer from physical water scarcity it also occurs where water seems abundant but where resources are over-committed such as when there is overdevelopment of hydraulic infrastructure for irrigation symptoms of physical water scarcity include environmental degradation and declining groundwater water stress harms living things because every organism needs water to live
renewable freshwater resources
renewable freshwater supply is a metric often used in conjunction when evaluating water scarcity this metric is informative because it can describe the total available water resource each country contains by knowing the total available water source an idea can be gained about whether a country is prone to experiencing physical water scarcity this metric has its faults in that it is an average  precipitation delivers water unevenly across the planet each year and annual renewable water resources vary from year to year this metric also does not describe the accessibility of water to individuals households industries or the government lastly as this metric is a description of a whole country it does not accurately portray whether a country is experiencing water scarcity canada and brazil both have very high levels of available water supply but still experience various water related problems
it can be observed that tropical countries in asia and africa have low availability of freshwater resources
the following table displays the average annual renewable freshwater supply by country including both surface-water and groundwater supplies this table represents data from the un fao aquastat much of which are produced by modeling or estimation as opposed to actual measurements
outlook
construction of wastewater treatment plants and reduction of groundwater overdrafting appear to be obvious solutions to the worldwide problem  however a deeper look reveals more fundamental issues in play wastewater treatment is highly capital intensive restricting access to this technology in some regions  furthermore the rapid increase in population of many countries makes this a race that is difficult to win as if those factors are not daunting enough one must consider the enormous costs and skill sets involved to maintain wastewater treatment plants even if they are successfully developed
reducing groundwater overdrafting is usually politically unpopular and can have major economic impacts on farmers moreover this strategy necessarily reduces crop output something the world can ill-afford given the current population
at more realistic levels developing countries can strive to achieve primary wastewater treatment or secure septic systems and carefully analyse wastewater outfall design to minimise impacts to drinking water and to ecosystems developed countries can not only share technology better including cost-effective wastewater and water treatment systems but also in hydrological transport modeling at the individual level people in developed countries can look inward and reduce overconsumption which further strains worldwide water consumption both developed and developing countries can increase protection of ecosystems especially wetlands and riparian zones these measures will not only conserve biota but also render more effective the natural water cycle flushing and transport that make water systems more healthy for humans
a range of local low-tech solutions are being pursued by a number of companies these efforts center around the use of solar power to distill water at temperatures slightly beneath that at which water boils by developing the capability to purify any available water source local business models could be built around the new technologies accelerating their uptake for example bedouins from the town of dahab in egypt have installed aquadania s waterstillar which uses a solar thermal collector measuring two square metres to distill from 40 to 60 litres per day from any local water source this is five times more efficient than conventional stills and eliminates the need for polluting plastic pet bottles or transportation of water supply
global experiences in managing water crisis
it is alleged that the likelihood of conflict rises if the rate of change within the basin exceeds the capacity of institution to absorb that change although water crisis is closely related to regional tensions history showed that acute conflicts over water are far less than the record of cooperation
the key lies in strong institutions and cooperation the indus river commission and the indus water treaty survived two wars between india and pakistan despite their hostility proving to be a successful mechanism in resolving conflicts by providing a framework for consultation inspection and exchange of data the mekong committee has also functioned since 1957 and survived the vietnam war in contrast regional instability results when there is an absence of institutions to co-operate in regional collaboration like egypt s plan for a high dam on the nile however there is currently no global institution in place for the management and management of trans-boundary water sources and international co-operation has happened through ad hoc collaborations between agencies like the mekong committee which was formed due to an alliance between unicef and the us bureau of reclamation formation of strong international institutions seems to be a way forward   they fuel early intervention and management preventing the costly dispute resolution process
one common feature of almost all resolved disputes is that the negotiations had a  need-based  instead of a  right based  paradigm irrigable lands population technicalities of projects define  needs  the success of a need-based paradigm is reflected in the only water agreement ever negotiated in the jordan river basin which focuses in needs not on rights of riparians in the indian subcontinent irrigation requirements of bangladesh determine water allocations of the ganges river a need based regional approach focuses on satisfying individuals with their need of water ensuring that minimum quantitative needs are being met it removes the conflict that arises when countries view the treaty from a national interest point of view move away from the zero-sum approach to a positive sum integrative approach that equitably allocated the water and its benefits
the blue peace framework developed by strategic foresight group in partnership with the governments of switzerland and sweden offers a unique policy structure which promotes sustainable management of water resources combined with cooperation for peace by making the most of shared water resources through cooperation rather than mere allocation between countries the chances for peace can be increased the blue peace approach has proven to be effective in cases like the middle east  and the nile basin
