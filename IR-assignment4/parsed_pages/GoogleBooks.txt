the publisher program was first known as  google print  when it was introduced at the frankfurt book fair in october 2004 the google books library project which scans works in the collections of library partners and adds them to the digital inventory was announced in december 2004
the google books initiative has been hailed for its potential to offer unprecedented access to what may become the largest online body of human knowledge and promoting the democratization of knowledge but it has also been criticized for potential copyright violations and lack of editing to correct the many errors introduced into the scanned texts by the ocr process
as of october 2015 the number of scanned book titles was over 25 million but the scanning process has slowed down in american academic libraries google estimated in 2010 that there were about 130 million distinct titles in the world and stated that it intended to scan all of them


details
results from google books show up in both the universal google search as well as in the dedicated google books search website  booksgooglecom 
in response to search queries google books allows users to view full pages from books in which the search terms appear if the book is out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission if google believes the book is still under copyright a user sees  snippets  of text around the queried search terms all instances of the search terms in the book text appear with a yellow highlight
the four access levels used on google books are 
in response to criticism from groups such as the american association of publishers and the authors guild google announced an opt-out policy in august 2005 through which copyright owners could provide a list of titles that it did not want scanned and google would respect the request google also stated that it would not scan any in-copyright books between august and 1 november 2005 to provide the owners with the opportunity to decide which books to exclude from the project thus google provides a copyright owner with three choices with respect to any work 
each book on google books has an associated  about this book  page which displays analytical information regarding the book such as a word map of the most used words and phrases a selection of pages list of related books list of scholarly articles and other books that cite the book and tables of content this information is collated through automated methods and sometimes data from third-party sources is used this information provides an insight into the book particularly useful when only a snippet view is available the list of related books can often contain irrelevant entries in some cases a book summary and information about the author is also displayed the page also displays bibliographic information which can be exported as citations in bibtex endnote and refman formats registered users logged in with their google accounts can post reviews for books on this page google books also displays reviews from goodreads alongside these reviews
most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available for those which are the site provides links to the website of the publisher and booksellers
linking
google books can retrieve scanned books from urls based on the international standard book numbers  isbn  library of congress control numbers  lccn  and online computer library center  oclc  record numbers for example the  about this book  page of a book with the isbn 0521349931 can be linked as booksgooglecom books vid isbn0521349931
for some books google also provides the ability to link directly to the front cover title page copyright page table of contents index and back cover of a book by using an appropriate parameter for example the front cover of a book with the oclc number 17546826 can be linked as booksgooglecom books vid oclc17546826 printsec frontcover
page numbering
for many books google books displays the original page numbers resulting in many benefits such as enabling writers to prepare citations with page numbers without needing to have a print copy of the book however tim parks writing in the new york review blogs noted that google had stopped providing page numbers for many recent publications  presumably in alliance with the publishers in order to force those of us who need to prepare footnotes to buy paper editions 
scanning of books
many of the books are scanned using a customized elphel 323 camera at a rate of 1,000 pages per hour a patent awarded to google in 2009 revealed that google had come up with an innovative system for scanning books that uses two cameras and infrared light to automatically correct for the curvature of pages in a book by constructing a 3d model of each page and then  de-warping  it google is able to present flat-looking pages without having to really make the pages flat which requires the use of destructive methods such as unbinding or glass plates to individually flatten each page which is inefficient for large scale scanning
n-gram viewer
n-gram is a service connected to google books it graphs the frequency of word usage across their book collection this service is important for historians and linguists as it can provide an inside look into human culture through word use throughout time periods this program has fallen under criticism because of metadata errors used in the program
errors
google allows users to report errors in books at the website supportgooglecom books partner troubleshooter 2983879
errors in content
the scanning process is subject to errors for example some pages may be unreadable upside down or in the wrong order scholars have even reported crumpled pages obscuring thumbs and fingers and smeared or blurry images on this issue a declaration from google at the end of scanned books says 
as of 2009 google stated that they would start using recaptcha to help fix the errors found in google book scanning s this method would only improve scanned words that are hard to recognize because of the scanning process and cannot solve errors such as turned pages or blocked words
errors in metadata
scholars have frequently reported rampant errors in the metadata information on google books   including misattributed authors and erroneous dates of publication geoffrey nunberg a linguist researching on the changes in word usage over time noticed that a search for books published before 1950 and containing the word  internet  turned up an unlikely 527 results woody allen is mentioned in 325 books ostensibly published before he was born google responded to nunberg by blaming the bulk of errors on the outside contractors
timeline
2002  a group of team members at google officially launch the  secret  books  project  google founders sergey brin and larry page came up with the idea that later became google books while still graduate students at stanford in 1996 the history page on the google books website describes their initial vision for this project   in a future world in which vast collections of books are digitized people would use a  web crawler  to index the books  content and analyze the connections between them determining any given book s relevance and usefulness by tracking the number and quality of citations from other books  this team visited the sites of some of the larger digitization efforts at that time including the library of congress s american memory project project gutenberg and the universal library to find out how they work as well as the university of michigan page s alma mater and the base for such digitization projects as jstor and making of america in a conversation with the at that time university president mary sue coleman when page found out that the university s current estimate for scanning all the library s volumes was 1,000 years page reportedly told coleman that he  believes google can help make it happen in six

books can also be made available for sale on google play
google books library project
the google books library project is an effort by google to scan and make searchable the collections of several major research libraries along with bibliographic information snippets of text from a book are often viewable if a book is out of copyright and in the public domain the book is fully available to read or to download
in-copyright books scanned through the library project are made available on google books for snippet view regarding the quality of scans google acknowledges that they are  not always of sufficiently high quality  to be offered for sale on google play also because of supposed technical constraints google does not replace scans with higher quality versions that may be provided by the publishers
the project is the subject of the authors guild v google lawsuit filed in 2005 and ruled in favor of google in 2013 and again on appeal in 2015
copyright owners can claim the rights for a scanned book and make it available for preview or full view  by  transferring  it to their partner program account  or request google to prevent the book text from being searched
the number of institutions participating in the library project has grown since its inception the university of mysore has been mentioned in many media reports as being a library partner although it is not listed as a partner by google

criticism
copyright infringement fair use and related issues
through the project library books were being digitized somewhat indiscriminately regardless of copyright status which led to a number of lawsuits against google by the end of 2008 google had reportedly digitized over seven million books of which only about one million were works in the public domain of the rest one million were in copyright and in print and five million were in copyright but out of print in 2005 a group of authors and publishers brought a major class-action lawsuit against google for infringement on the copyrighted works google argued that it was preserving  orphaned works    books still under copyright but whose copyright holders could not be located
the authors guild and association of american publishers separately sued google in 2005 for its book project citing  massive copyright infringement  google countered that its project represented a fair use and is the digital age equivalent of a card catalog with every word in the publication indexed the lawsuits were consolidated and eventually a settlement was proposed the settlement received significant criticism on a wide variety of grounds including antitrust privacy and inadequacy of the proposed classes of authors and publishers the settlement was eventually rejected and the publishers settled with google soon after the authors guild continued its case and in 2011 their proposed class was certified google appealed that decision with a number of amici asserting the inadequacy of the class and the second circuit rejected the class certification in july 2013 remanding the case to the district court for consideration of google s fair use defense
in 2015 authors guild filed another appeal against google to be considered by the 2nd us circuit court of appeals in new york google won the case unanimously based on the argument that they were not showing people the full texts but instead snippets and there are not allowing people to illegally read the book in a report courts stated that they did not infringe on copy write laws as they were protected under the fair use clause
authors guild tried again in 2016 to appeal the decision and this time took their case to be considered by the supreme court the case was rejected leaving the second circuits decision on the case in tact meaning that google did not violate copy right laws this case also set a precedent for other case similar in regards to fair use laws as it further clarified the law and expands it such clarification is important in the new digital age as it effects other scanning projects similar to google
other lawsuits followed the authors guild s lead in 2006 a german lawsuit previously filed was withdrawn in june 2006 herv  de la martini re a french publisher known as la martini re and  ditions du seuil announced its intention to sue google france in 2009 the paris civil court awarded 300,000 eur  approximately 430,000 usd  in damages and interest and ordered google to pay 10,000 eur a day until it removes the publisher s books from its database the court wrote  google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible  books that seuil owns without its permission and that google  committed acts of breach of copyright which are of harm to the publishers  google said it will appeal syndicat national de l edition which joined the lawsuit said google has scanned about 100,000 french works under copyright
in december 2009 chinese author mian mian filed a civil lawsuit for  8,900 against google for scanning her novel acid lovers this is the first such lawsuit to be filed against google in china also in november that year the china written works copyright society  cwwcs  accused google of scanning 18,000 books by 570 chinese writers without authorization google agreed on nov 20 to provide a list of chinese books it had scanned but the company refused to admit having  infringed  copyright laws
in march 2007 thomas rubin associate general counsel for copyright trademark and trade secrets at microsoft accused google of violating copyright law with their book search service rubin specifically criticized google s policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop
google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of digital watermarking techniques with the books some published works that are in the public domain such as all works created by the us federal government are still treated like other works under copyright and therefore locked after 1922
academic criticism
for many scholars a far more egregious problem with the project stems from the fact that it does not seem to be meeting its fundamental state goal of  preserving  orphaned and out-of-print works google has apparently been passing huge numbers of scanned and electronic-text books into circulation without editing the texts for errors introduced by the digitizing processes this problem has been apparent for a number of years but became obvious in a big way in 2014 when google formed a partnership with bookseller barnes   noble through which google made more than a half a million public domain texts available to barnes   noble to be offered for free on the nook shop for their e-readers
customers downloading these books discovered that as many as 80  of them were essentially unreadable riddled with a large number of errors introduced by either the scanning process itself or the conversion of the scans into electronic texts via optical character recognition  ocr  software google apparently scanned the texts but did not trouble to edit them for errors and barnes   noble compounded the problem by not exercising any quality control over the google texts simply offering them unexamined in their shop to customers the effect of the scan and ocr errors is to render the contents of many books essentially unreadable a problem especially in scientific works where incorrectly rendered missing or extraneous characters in scientific equations may render them meaningless
also of concern are the large numbers of metadata errors in the google collection metadata refers to the information which identifies a particular text  title author publisher publication place and date subject classification etc   essentially the information which would be found in a library card catalog
one investigator found thousands of such errors in the samples he took including publication dates that predated the birth of the books  author  eg 182 works by charles dickens supposedly published prior to his birth in 1812  wildly inappropriate subject classifications  an edition of moby dick found under  computers  a biography of mae west classified under  religion   conflicting classifications  10 editions of whitman s leaves of grass all classified as both  fiction  and  nonfiction   incorrectly spelled titles authors and publishers  moby dick   or the white  wall   metadata for one book incorrectly appended to a completely different book  the metadata for an 1818 mathematical work leads to a 1963 romance novel  books about the internet with publication dated before the internet existed and many more
such metadata errors can make doing serious research using the google books project database difficult if not impossible   even assuming all of the scanned texts were edited and error corrected to date google has shown only limited interest in cleaning up these errors
language issues
some european politicians and intellectuals have criticized google s effort on linguistic imperialism grounds they argue that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in english it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world german russian french and spanish for instance are popular languages in scholarship the disproportionate online emphasis on english however could shape access to historical scholarship and ultimately the growth and direction of future scholarship among these critics is jean-no l jeanneney the former president of the biblioth que nationale de france
google books versus google scholar
while google books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues its scans do not include the metadata required for identifying specific articles in specific issues this has led the makers of google scholar to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles  in agreement with their publishers
