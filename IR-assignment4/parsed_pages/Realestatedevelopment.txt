organizing for development
a development team can be put together in one of several ways at one extreme a large company might include many services from architecture to engineering at the other end of the spectrum a development company might consist of one principal and a few staff who hire or contract with other companies and professionals for each service as needed
assembling a team of professionals to address the environmental economic private physical and political issues inherent in a complex development project is critical a developer s success depends on the ability to coordinate and lead the completion of a series of interrelated activities efficiently and at the appropriate time
development process requires skills of many professionals  architects landscape architects civil engineers and site planners to address project design  market consultants to determine demand and a project s economics  attorneys to handle agreements and government approvals  environmental consultants and soils engineers to analyze a site s physical limitations and environmental impacts  surveyors and title companies to provide legal descriptions of a property  and lenders to provide financing the general contractor of the project hires subcontractors to put the architectural plans into action
land development
purchasing unused land for a potential development is sometimes called speculative development
subdivision of land is the principal mechanism by which communities are developed technically subdivision describes the legal and physical steps a developer must take to convert raw land into developed land subdivision is a vital part of a community s growth determining its appearance the mix of its land uses and its infrastructure including roads drainage systems water sewerage and public utilities
in general land development is the riskiest but most profitable technique as it is so dependent on the public sector for approvals and infrastructure and because it involves a long investment period with no positive cash flow
after subdivision is complete the developer usually markets the land to a home builder or other end user for such uses as a warehouse or shopping center in any case use of spatial intelligence tools mitigate the risk of these developers by modeling the population trends and demographic make-up of the sort of customers a home builder or retailer would like to have surrounding their new development
