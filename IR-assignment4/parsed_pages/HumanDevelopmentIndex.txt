human development index - wikipedia
the human development index  hdi  is a composite statistic of life expectancy education and per capita income indicators which are used to rank countries into four tiers of human development a country scores higher hdi when the lifespan is higher the education level is higher the gdp per capita is higher the fertility rate is lower and the inflation rate is lower the hdi was developed by the pakistani economist mahbub ul haq working alongside indian economist amartya sen often framed in terms of whether people are able to  be  and  do  desirable things in their life and was published by the united nations development programme
the 2010 human development report introduced an inequality-adjusted human development index  ihdi  while the simple hdi remains useful it stated that  the ihdi is the actual level of human development  accounting for inequality   and  the hdi can be viewed as an index of  potential  human development  or the maximum ihdi that could be achieved if there were no inequality  


origins
the origins of the hdi are found in the annual human development reports produced by the human development reports office of the united nations development programme  undp  these were devised and launched by pakistani economist mahbub ul haq in 1990 and had the explicit purpose  to shift the focus of development economics from national income accounting to people-centered policies  to produce the human development reports mahbub ul haq formed a group of development economists including paul streeten frances stewart gustav ranis keith griffin sudhir anand and meghnad desai working alongside nobel laureate amartya sen they worked on capabilities and functions that provided the underlying conceptual framework haq was sure that a simple composite measure of human development was needed in order to convince the public academics and politicians that they can and should evaluate development not only by economic advances but also improvements in human well-being sen initially opposed this idea but he was helped by haq in order to develop the index sen was worried that it was going to be difficult to capture the full complexity of human capabilities in a single index but haq requested him that only a single number would shift the immediate attention of politicians from economic to human well-being
dimensions and calculation
new method  2010 report onwards 
published on 4 november 2010  and updated on 10 june 2011  the 2010 human development report  hdi  combines three dimensions 
in its 2010 human development report the undp began using a new method of calculating the hdi the following three indices are used 
1 life expectancy index  lei

eys  expected years of schooling  years of schooling for children under 18 years of age 
gnipc  gross national income at purchasing power parity per capita
old method  before 2010 report 
the hdi combined three dimensions last used in its 2009 report 
this methodology was used by the undp until their 2011 report
the formula defining the hdi is promulgated by the united nations development programme  undp  in general to transform a raw variable say 



x


  displaystyle x 

 into a unit-free index between 0 and 1  which allows different indices to be added together  the following formula is used 
where

 are the lowest and highest values the variable

 can attain respectively
the human development index  hdi  then represents the uniformly weighted sum with   contributed by each of the following factor indices 
other organizations companies may include other factors such as infant mortality which produces a different hdi

countries not included
some countries were not included for various reasons mainly the unavailability of certain crucial data the following united nations member states were not included in the 2010 report cuba lodged a formal protest at its lack of inclusion the undp explained that cuba had been excluded due to the lack of an  internationally reported figure for cuba s gross national income adjusted for purchasing power parity  all other indicators for cuba were available and reported by the undp but the lack of one indicator meant that no ranking could be attributed to the country the situation has been addressed and in later years cuba has ranked as a high human development country
2009 human development report
the 2009 human development report by the undp was released on october 5 2009 and covers the period up to 2007 it was titled  overcoming barriers  human mobility and development  the top countries by hdi were grouped in a new category called  very high human development  the report refers to these countries as developed countries they are 
countries not included
some countries were not included for various reasons such as being a non-un member or unable or unwilling to provide the necessary data at the time of publication besides the states with limited recognition the following states were also not included
2008 statistical update
a new index was released on december 18 2008 this so-called  statistical update  covered the period up to 2006 and was published without an accompanying human development report the update is relevant due to newly released estimates of purchasing power parities  ppp  implying substantial adjustments for many countries resulting in changes in hdi values and in many cases hdi ranks
countries not included
some countries were not included for various reasons such as being a non-un member unable or unwilling to provide the necessary data at the time of publication besides the states with limited recognition the following states were also not included
2007 2008 human development report
the human development report for 2007 2008 was launched in bras lia brazil on november 27 2007 its focus was on  fighting climate change  human solidarity in a divided world  most of the data used for the report are derived largely from 2005 or earlier thus indicating an hdi for 2005 not all un member states choose to or are able to provide the necessary statistics
the report showed a small increase in world hdi in comparison with last year s report this rise was fueled by a general improvement in the developing world especially of the least developed countries group this marked improvement at the bottom was offset with a decrease in hdi of high income countries
a hdi below 0.5 is considered to represent  low development  all 22 countries in that category are located in africa the highest-scoring sub-saharan countries gabon and south africa are ranked 119th and 121st respectively nine countries departed from this category this year and joined the  medium development  group
a hdi of 0.8 or more is considered to represent  high development  this includes all developed countries such as those in north america western europe oceania and eastern asia as well as some developing countries in eastern europe central and south america southeast asia the caribbean and the oil-rich arabian peninsula seven countries were promoted to this category this year leaving the  medium development  group  albania belarus brazil libya macedonia russia and saudi arabia
on the following table green arrows    represent an increase in ranking over the previous study while red arrows    represent a decrease in ranking they are followed by the number of spaces they moved blue dashes    represent a nation that did not move in the rankings since the previous study

criticism
the human development index has been criticized on a number of grounds including alleged ideological biases towards egalitarianism and so-called  western models of development  failure to include any ecological considerations lack of consideration of technological development or contributions to the human civilization focusing exclusively on national performance and ranking lack of attention to development from a global perspective measurement error of the underlying statistics and on the undp s changes in formula which can lead to severe misclassification in the categorisation of  low   medium   high  or  very high  human development countries
economists hendrik wolff howard chong and maximilian auffhammer discuss the hdi from the perspective of data error in the underlying health education and income statistics used to construct the hdi they identified three sources of data error which are due to  i  data updating  ii  formula revisions and  iii  thresholds to classify a country s development status and conclude that 11  21  and 34  of all countries can be interpreted as currently misclassified in the development bins due to the three sources of data error respectively the authors suggest that the united nations should discontinue the practice of classifying countries into development bins because - they claim - the cut-off values seem arbitrary can provide incentives for strategic behavior in reporting official statistics and have the potential to misguide politicians investors charity donors and the public who use the hdi at large in 2010 the undp reacted to the criticism and updated the thresholds to classify nations as low medium and high human development countries in a comment to the economist in early january 2011 the human development report office responded to a january 6 2011 article in the magazine which discusses the wolff et al paper the human development report office states that they undertook a systematic revision of the methods used for the calculation of the hdi and that the new methodology directly addresses the critique by wolff et al in that it generates a system for continuous updating of the human development categories whenever formula or data revisions take place
geographical coverage
the hdi has extended its geographical coverage  david hastings of the united nations economic and social commission for asia and the pacific published a report geographically extending the hdi to 230  economies whereas the undp hdi for 2009 enumerates 182 economies and coverage for the 2010 hdi dropped to 169 countries
