land development - wikipedia
land development refers to altering the landscape in any number of ways such as 


economic aspects
in an economics context land development is also sometimes advertised as land improvement or land amelioration it refers to investments making land more usable by humans for accounting purposes it refers to any variety of projects that increase the value of the property most are depreciable but some land improvements are not able to be depreciated because a useful life cannot be determined home building and containment are two of the most common and the oldest types of development
in an urban context land development furthermore includes 
landowner or developers on any size of project will often want to maximise profits minimise risk and control cash flow this  profit enhancement  means identifying and developing the best scheme for the local marketplace whilst satisfying the local planning process
development analysis puts development prospects and the development process itself under the microscope identifying where enhancements and improvements can be introduced these improvements aim to align with best design practice political sensitivities and the inevitable social requirements of a project with the overarching objective of increasing land values and profit margins on behalf of the landowner or developer
development analysis can add significantly to the value of land and development and as such is a crucial tool for landowners and developers it is an essential step in kevin a lynch s 1960 book the image of the city and is considered to be essential to realizing the value potential of land the landowner can share in additional planning gain  significant value uplift  via an awareness of the land s development potential this is done via a residual development appraisal or residual valuation the residual appraisal calculates the sale value of the end product  the gross development value or gdv  and hypothetically deducts costs including planning and construction costs finance costs and developer s profit the  residue  or leftover proportion represents the land value therefore in maximising the gdv  that which one could build on the land  land value is concurrently enhanced
land value is highly sensitive to supply and demand  for the end product  build costs planning and affordable housing contributions and so on understanding the intricacies of the development system and the effect of  value drivers  can result in massive differences in the landowner s sale value
conversion of landforms
land development puts more emphasis on the expected economic development as a result of the process   land conversion  tries to focus on the general physical and biological aspects of the land use change  land improvement  in the economic sense can often lead to land degradation from the ecological perspective land development and the change in land value does not usually take into account changes in the ecology of the developed area while conversion of  rural  land with a vegetation carpet to building land may result in a rise in economic growth and rising land prices the irreversibility of lost flora and fauna because of habitat destruction the loss of ecosystem services and resulting decline in environmental value is only considered a priori in environmental full-cost accounting
conversion to building land
conversion to building land is as a rule associated with road building which in itself already brings topsoil abrasion soil compaction and modification of the soil s chemical composition through soil stabilization creation of impervious surfaces and subsequently  polluted  surface runoff water
construction activity often effectively seals off a larger part of the soil from rainfall and the nutrient cycle so that the soil below buildings and roads is effectively  consumed  and made infertile
with the notable exception of attempts at rooftop gardening and hanging gardens in green buildings  possibly as constituents of green urbanism  vegetative cover of higher plants is lost to concrete and asphalt surfaces complementary interspersed garden and park areas notwithstanding
conversion to farmland
new creation of farmland will rely on the conversion and development of previous forests savannas or grassland recreation of farmland from wasteland deserts or previous impervious surfaces is considerably less frequent because of the degraded or missing fertile soil in the latter starting from forests land is made arable by assarting or slash-and-burn agricultural development furthermore includes 
because the newly created farmland is more prone to erosion than soil stabilized by tree roots such a conversion may mean irreversible crossing of an ecological threshold
the resulting deforestation is also not easily compensated for by reforestation or afforestation this is because plantations of other trees as a means for water conservation and protection against wind erosion  shelterbelts  as a rule lack the biodiversity of the lost forest especially when realized as monocultures also soil stabilization and erosion control measures may not be as effective in preserving topsoil as the previous intact vegetation
restoration
massive land conversion without proper consideration of ecological and geological consequences may lead to disastrous results such as 
while deleterious effects can be particularly visible when land is developed for industrial or mining usage agro-industrial and settlement use can also have a massive and sometimes irreversible impact on the affected ecosystem
examples of land restoration land rehabilitation counted as land development in the strict sense are still rare however renaturation reforestation stream restoration may all contribute to a healthier environment and quality of life especially in densely populated regions the same is true for planned vegetation like parks and gardens but restoration plays a particular role because it reverses previous conversions to built and agricultural areas
