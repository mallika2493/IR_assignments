agroforestry - wikipedia
agroforestry or agro-sylviculture is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastureland it combines shrubs and trees in agricultural and forestry technologies to create more diverse productive profitable healthy ecologically sound and sustainable land-use systems


as a science
the theoretical base for agroforestry comes from ecology via agroecology from this perspective agroforestry is one of the three principal land-use sciences the other two are agriculture and forestry
agroforestry has a lot in common with intercropping both have two or more plant species  such as nitrogen-fixing plants  in close interaction both provide multiple outputs as a consequence higher overall yields and because a single application or input is shared costs are reduced beyond these there are gains specific to agroforestry
benefits
agroforestry systems can be advantageous over conventional agricultural and forest production methods they can offer increased productivity economic benefits and more diversity in the ecological goods and services provided  an example of this was seen in trying to conserve milicia excelsa 
biodiversity in agroforestry systems is typically higher than in conventional agricultural systems with two or more interacting plant species in a given land area it creates a more complex habitat that can support a wider variety of birds insects and other animals depending upon the application impacts of agroforestry can include 
agroforestry practices may also realize a number of other associated environmental goals such as 
adaptation to climate change
there is some evidence that especially in recent years poor smallholder farmers are turning to agroforestry as a mean to adapt to the impacts of climate change a study from the cgiar research program on climate change agriculture and food security  ccafs  found from a survey of over 700 households in east africa that at least 50  of those households had begun planting trees on their farms in a change from their practices 10 years ago the trees ameliorate the effects of climate change by helping to stabilize erosion improving water and soil quality and providing yields of fruit tea coffee oil fodder and medicinal products in addition to their usual harvest agroforestry was one of the most widely adopted adaptation strategies in the study along with the use of improved crop varieties and intercropping
applications
agroforestry represents a wide diversity in application and in practice one listing includes over 50 distinct uses the 50 or so applications can be roughly classified under a few broad headings there are visual similarities between practices in different categories this is expected as categorization is based around the problems addressed  countering winds high rainfall harmful insects etc  and the overall economic constraints and objectives  labor and other inputs costs yield requirements etc  the categories include  
parkland
parklands are visually defined by the presence of trees widely scattered over a large agricultural plot or pasture the trees are usually of a single species with clear regional favorites among the beaks and benefits the trees offer shade to grazing animals protect crops against strong wind bursts provide tree prunings for firewood and are a roost for insect or rodent-eating birds
there are other gains research with faidherbia albida in zambia showed that mature trees can sustain maize yields of 4.1 tonnes per hectare compared to 1.3 tonnes per hectare without these trees unlike other trees faidherbia sheds its nitrogen-rich leaves during the rainy crop growing season so it does not compete with the crop for light nutrients and water the leaves then regrow during the dry season and provide land cover and shade for crops
shade systems
with shade applications crops are purposely raised under tree canopies and within the resulting shady environment for most uses the understory crops are shade tolerant or the overstory trees have fairly open canopies a conspicuous example is shade-grown coffee this practice reduces weeding costs and improves the quality and taste of the coffee just because plants are grown under shade does not necessarily translate into lost or reduced yields this is because the efficiency of photosynthesis drops off with increasing light intensity and the rate of photosynthesis hardly increases once the light intensity is over about one tenth that of direct overhead sun this means that plants under trees can still grow well even though they get less light by having more than one level of vegetation it is possible to get more photosynthesis and overall yields than with a single canopy layer
crop-over-tree systems
not commonly encountered crop-over-tree systems employ woody perennials in the role of a cover crop for this small shrubs or trees pruned to near ground level are utilized the purpose as with any cover crop is to increase in-soil nutrients and or to reduce soil erosion
alley cropping
with alley cropping crop strips alternate with rows of closely spaced tree or hedge species normally the trees are pruned before planting the crop the cut leafy material is spread over the crop area to provide nutrients for the crop in addition to nutrients the hedges serve as windbreaks and eliminate soil erosion
alley cropping has been shown to be advantageous in africa particularly in relation to improving maize yields in the sub-saharan region use here relies upon the nitrogen fixing tree species sesbania sesban euphorbia tricalii tephrosia vogelii gliricidia sepium and faidherbia albida in one example a ten-year experiment in malawi showed that by using the fertilizer tree gliricidia  gliricidia sepium  on land on which no mineral fertilizer was applied maize yields averaged 3.3 tonnes per hectare as compared to one tonne per hectare in plots without fertilizer trees nor mineral fertilizers
strip cropping
strip cropping is similar to alley cropping in that trees alternate with crops the difference is that with alley cropping the trees are in single row with strip cropping the trees or shrubs are planted in wide strip the purpose can be as with alley cropping to provide nutrients in leaf form to the crop with strip cropping the trees can have a purely productive role providing fruits nuts etc while at the same time protecting nearby crops from soil erosion and harmful winds
fauna-based systems
there are situations where trees benefit fauna the most common examples are the silvopasture where cattle goats or sheep browse on grasses grown under trees in hot climates the animals are less stressed and put on weight faster when grazing in a cooler shaded environment other variations have these animals directly eating the leaves of trees or shrubs
there are similar systems for other types of fauna deer and hogs gain when living and feeding in a forest ecosystem especially when the tree forage suits their dietary needs another variation aquaforestry is where trees shade fish ponds in many cases the fish eat the leaves or fruit from the trees
boundary systems
there are a number of applications that fall under the heading of a boundary system these include the living fences the riparian buffer and windbreaks
taungya
taungya is a vastly used system originating in burma in the initial stages of an orchard or tree plantation the trees are small and widely spaced the free space between the newly planted trees can accommodate a seasonal crop instead of costly weeding the underutilized area provides an additional output and income more complex taungyas use the between-tree space for a series of crops the crops become more shade resistant as the tree canopies grow and the amount of sunlight reaching the ground declines if a plantation is thinned in the latter stages this opens further the between-tree cropping opportunities
physical support systems
in the long history of agriculture trellises are comparatively recent before this grapes and other vine crops were raised atop pruned trees variations of the physical support theme depend upon the type of vine the advantages come through greater in-field biodiversity in many cases the control of weeds diseases and insect pests are primary motives
agroforests
these are widely found in the humid tropics and are referenced by different names  forest gardening forest farming tropical home gardens and where short-statured trees or shrubs dominate shrub gardens  through a complex diverse mix of trees shrubs vines and seasonal crops these systems achieve the ecological dynamics of a forest ecosystem because of their internal ecology they tend to be less susceptible to harmful insects plant diseases drought and wind damage
historical use
agroforestry similar methods were historically utilized by native americans california indians would prescribe burn oak and other habitats to maintain a  pyrodiversity collecting model  this method allowed for greater health of trees and the habitat in general
challenges
agroforestry is relevant to almost all environments and is a potential response to common problems around the globe and agroforestry systems can be advantageous compared to conventional agriculture or forestry yet agroforestry is not very widespread at least according to current but incomplete usda surveys as of november 2013
as suggested by a survey of extension programs in the united states some obstacles  ordered most critical to least critical  to agroforestry adoption include 
some solutions to these obstacles have already been suggested although many depend on particular circumstances which vary from one location to the next
