environmental impact of agriculture - wikipedia
the environmental impact of agriculture varies based on the wide variety of agricultural practices employed around the world ultimately the environmental impact depends on the production practices of the system used by farmers the connection between emissions into the environment and the farming system is indirect as it also depends on other climate variables such as rainfall and temperature
there are two types of indicators of environmental impact   means-based  which is based on the farmer s production methods and  effect-based  which is the impact that farming methods have on the farming system or on emissions to the environment an example of a means-based indicator would be the quality of groundwater that is effected by the amount of nitrogen applied to the soil an indicator reflecting the loss of nitrate to groundwater would be effect-based
the environmental impact of agriculture involves a variety of factors from the soil to water the air animal and soil diversity people plants and the food itself some of the environmental issues that are related to agriculture are climate change deforestation genetic engineering irrigation problems pollutants soil degradation and waste


issues
climate change
climate change and agriculture are interrelated processes both of which take place on a worldwide scale global warming is projected to have significant impacts on conditions affecting agriculture including temperature precipitation and glacial run-off these conditions determine the carrying capacity of the biosphere to produce enough food for the human population and domesticated animals rising carbon dioxide levels would also have effects both detrimental and beneficial on crop yields assessment of the effects of global climate changes on agriculture might help to properly anticipate and adapt farming to maximize agricultural production although the net impact of climate change on agricultural production is uncertain it is likely that it will shift the suitable growing zones for individual crops adjustment to this geographical shift will involve considerable economic costs and social impacts
at the same time agriculture has been shown to produce significant effects on climate change primarily through the production and release of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide in addition agriculture that practices tillage fertilization and pesticide application also releases ammonia nitrate phosphorus and many other pesticides that affect air water and soil quality as well as biodiversity agriculture also alters the earth s land cover which can change its ability to absorb or reflect heat and light thus contributing to radiative forcing land use change such as deforestation and desertification together with use of fossil fuels are the major anthropogenic sources of carbon dioxide  agriculture itself is the major contributor to increasing methane and nitrous oxide concentrations in earth s atmosphere
deforestation
deforestation is clearing the earth s forests on a large scale worldwide and resulting in many land damages one of the causes of deforestation is to clear land for pasture or crops according to british environmentalist norman myers 5  of deforestation is due to cattle ranching 19  due to over-heavy logging 22  due to the growing sector of palm oil plantations and 54  due to slash-and-burn farming
deforestation causes the loss of habitat for millions of species and is also a driver of climate change trees act as a carbon sink  that is they absorb carbon dioxide an unwanted greenhouse gas out of the atmosphere removing trees releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and leaves behind fewer trees to absorb the increasing amount of carbon dioxide in the air in this way deforestation exacerbates climate change when trees are removed from forests the soils tend to dry out because there is no longer shade and there are not enough trees to assist in the water cycle by returning water vapor back to the environment with no trees landscapes that were once forests can potentially become barren deserts the removal of trees also causes extreme fluctuations in temperature
in 2000 the united nations food and agriculture organization  fao  found that  the role of population dynamics in a local setting may vary from decisive to negligible  and that deforestation can result from  a combination of population pressure and stagnating economic social and technological conditions 
genetic engineering
genetically engineered crops are herbicide-tolerant and their overuse has created herbicide resistant  super weeds  which may ultimately increase the use of herbicides seed contamination is another problem of genetic engineering  it can occur from wind or bee pollination that is blown from genetically-engineered crops to normal crops about 50  of corn and soybean samples and more than 80  of canola samples were found to be contaminated by monsanto s  genetic engineering company  genes this accidental contamination can cause organic farmers to lose a lot of money because they need to recall their products there are various cases of this such as in the corn and alfalfa industry
irrigation
irrigation can lead to a number of problems 
among some of these problems is the depletion of underground aquifers through overdrafting soil can be over-irrigated because of poor distribution uniformity or management wastes water chemicals and may lead to water pollution over-irrigation can cause deep drainage from rising water tables that can lead to problems of irrigation salinity requiring watertable control by some form of subsurface land drainage however if the soil is under irrigated it gives poor soil salinity control which leads to increased soil salinity with consequent buildup of toxic salts on soil surface in areas with high evaporation this requires either leaching to remove these salts and a method of drainage to carry the salts away irrigation with saline or high-sodium water may damage soil structure owing to the formation of alkaline soil
pollutants
synthetic pesticides such as  malathon  rogor   kelthane  and  confidor  are the most widespread method of controlling pests in agriculture pesticides can leach through the soil and enter the groundwater as well as linger in food products and result in death in humans pesticides can also kill non-target plants birds fish and other wildlife a wide range of agricultural chemicals are used and some become pollutants through use misuse or ignorance pollutants from agriculture have a huge effect on water quality agricultural nonpoint source  nps  solution impacts lakes rivers wetlands estuaries and groundwater agricultural nps can be caused by poorly managed animal feeding operations overgrazing plowing fertilizer and improper excessive or badly timed use of pesticides pollutants from farming include sediments nutrients pathogens pesticides metals and salts
listed below are additional and specific problems that may arise with the release of pollutants from agriculture
soil degradation
soil degradation is the decline in soil quality that can be a result of many factors especially from agriculture soils hold the majority of the world s biodiversity and healthy soils are essential for food production and an adequate water supply common attributes of soil degradation can be salting waterlogging compaction pesticide contamination decline in soil structure quality loss of fertility changes in soil acidity alkalinity salinity and erosion soil degradation also has a huge impact on biological degradation which affects the microbial community of the soil and can alter nutrient cycling pest and disease control and chemical transformation properties of the soil
waste
plasticulture is the use of plastic mulch in agriculture farmers use plastic sheets as mulch to cover 50-70  of the soil and allows them to use drip irrigation systems to have better control over soil nutrients and moisture rain is not required in this system and farms that use plasticulture are built to encourage the fastest runoff of rain the use of pesticides with plasticulture allows pesticides to be transported easier in the surface runoff towards wetlands or tidal creeks the runoff from pesticides and chemicals in the plastic can cause serious deformations and death in shellfish as the runoff carries the chemicals towards the oceans
in addition to the increased runoff that results from plasticulture there is also the problem of the increased amount of waste form the plastic mulch itself the use of plastic mulch for vegetables strawberries and other row and orchard crops exceeds 110 million pounds annually in the united states most plastic ends up in the landfill although there are other disposal options such as disking mulches into the soil on-site burying on-site storage reuse recycling and incineration the incineration and recycling options are complicated by the variety of the types of plastics that are used and by the geographic dispersal of the plastics plastics also contain stabilizers and dyes as well as heavy metals which limits the amount of products that can be recycled research is continually being conducted on creating biodegradable or photodegradable mulches while there has been minor success with this there is also the problem of how long the plastic takes to degrade as many biodegradable products take a long time to break down
issues by region
the environmental impact of agriculture can vary depending on the region as well as the type of agriculture production method that is being used listed below are some specific environmental issues in a various different regions around the world
sustainable agriculture
the exponential population increase in recent decades has increased the practice of agricultural land conversion to meet demand for food which in turn has increased the effects on the environment the global population is still increasing and will eventually stabilise as some critics doubt that food production due to lower yields from global warming can support the global population
organic farming is a multifaceted sustainable agriculture set of practices that can have a lower impact on the environment at the small scale however in most cases organic farming results in lower yields in terms of production per unit area and per unit of irrigation water therefore widespread adoption of organic agriculture will require additional land to be cleared and water resources extracted to meet the same level of production a european meta-analysis found that organic farms tended to have higher soil organic matter content and lower nutrient losses  nitrogen leaching nitrous oxide emissions and ammonia emissions  per unit of  eld area but higher ammonia emissions nitrogen leaching and nitrous oxide emissions per product unit
other specific methods include  permaculture  and biodynamic agriculture which incorporates a spiritual element
