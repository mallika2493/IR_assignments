desertification - wikipedia
desertification is a type of land degradation in which relatively dry area of land becomes increasingly arid typically losing its bodies of water as well as vegetation and wildlife it is caused by a variety of factors such as climate change and human activities desertification is a significant global ecological and environmental problem


definitions
considerable controversy exists over the proper definition of the term  desertification  for which helmut geist  2005  has identified more than 100 formal definitions the most widely accepted of these is that of the princeton university dictionary which defines it as  the process of fertile land transforming into desert typically as a result of deforestation drought or improper inappropriate agriculture 
desertification has been neatly defined in the text of the united nations convention to combat desertification  unccd  as  land degradation in arid semi-arid and dry sub-humid regions resulting from various factors including climatic variations and human activities 
the earliest known discussion of the topic arose soon after the french colonization of west africa when the comit  d etudes commissioned a study on dess chement progressif to explore the prehistoric expansion of the sahara desert
history
the world s most noted deserts have been formed by natural processes interacting over long intervals of time during most of these times deserts have grown and shrunk independent of human activities paleodeserts are large sand seas now inactive because they are stabilized by vegetation some extending beyond the present margins of core deserts such as the sahara the largest hot desert
desertification has played a significant role in human history contributing to the collapse of several large empires such as carthage greece and the roman empire as well as causing displacement of local populations historical evidence shows that the serious and extensive land deterioration occurring several centuries ago in arid regions had three epicenters  the mediterranean the mesopotamian valley and the loess plateau of china where population was dense
areas affected
drylands occupy approximately 40 41  of earth s land area and are home to more than 2 billion people it has been estimated that some 10 20  of drylands are already degraded the total area affected by desertification being between 6 and 12 million square kilometres that about 1 6  of the inhabitants of drylands live in desertified areas and that a billion people are under threat from further desertification
as of 1998 the then-current degree of southward expansion of the sahara was not well known due to a lack of recent measurable expansion of the desert into the sahel at the time
vegetation patterning
as the desertification takes place the landscape may progress through different stages and continuously transform in appearance on gradually sloped terrain desertification can create increasingly larger empty spaces over a large strip of land a phenomenon known as  brousse tigr e  a mathematical model of this phenomenon proposed by c klausmeier attributes this patterning to dynamics in plant-water interaction one outcome of this observation suggests an optimal planting strategy for agriculture in arid environments
causes
the immediate cause is the loss of most vegetation this is driven by a number of factors alone or in combination such as drought climatic shifts tillage for agriculture overgrazing and deforestation for fuel or construction materials vegetation plays a major role in determining the biological composition of the soil studies have shown that in many environments the rate of erosion and runoff decreases exponentially with increased vegetation cover unprotected dry soil surfaces blow away with the wind or are washed away by flash floods leaving infertile lower soil layers that bake in the sun and become an unproductive hardpan controversially allan savory has claimed that the controlled movement of herds of livestock mimicking herds of grazing wildlife can reverse desertification
poverty
at least 90  of the inhabitants of drylands live in developing nations where they also suffer from poor economic and social conditions this situation is exacerbated by land degradation because of the reduction in productivity the precariousness of living conditions and the difficulty of access to resources and opportunities
a downward spiral is created in many underdeveloped countries by overgrazing land exhaustion and overdrafting of groundwater in many of the marginally productive world regions due to overpopulation pressures to exploit marginal drylands for farming decision-makers are understandably averse to invest in arid zones with low potential this absence of investment contributes to the marginalisation of these zones when unfavourable agro-climatic conditions are combined with an absence of infrastructure and access to markets as well as poorly adapted production techniques and an underfed and undereducated population most such zones are excluded from development
desertification often causes rural lands to become unable to support the same sized populations that previously lived there this results in mass migrations out of rural areas and into urban areas particularly in africa these migrations into the cities often cause large numbers of unemployed people who end up living in slums
countermeasures and prevention
techniques exist for mitigating or reversing the effects of desertification  however there are numerous barriers to their implementation one of these is that the costs of adopting sustainable agricultural practices sometimes exceed the benefits for individual farmers even while they are socially and environmentally beneficial another issue is a lack of political will and lack of funding to support land reclamation and anti-desertification programs
desertification is recognized as a major threat to biodiversity some countries have developed biodiversity action plans to counter its effects particularly in relation to the protection of endangered flora and fauna
reforestation gets at one of the root causes of desertification and is not just a treatment of the symptoms environmental organizations work in places where deforestation and desertification are contributing to extreme poverty there they focus primarily on educating the local population about the dangers of deforestation and sometimes employ them to grow seedlings which they transfer to severely deforested areas during the rainy season the food and agriculture organization of the united nations launched the fao drylands restoration initiative in 2012 to draw together knowledge and experience on dryland restoration in 2015 fao published global guidelines for the restoration of degraded forests and landscapes in drylands in collaboration with the turkish ministry of forestry and water affairs and the turkish cooperation and coordination agency
techniques focus on two aspects  provisioning of water and fixation and hyper-fertilizing soil
fixating the soil is often done through the use of shelter belts woodlots and windbreaks windbreaks are made from trees and bushes and are used to reduce soil erosion and evapotranspiration they were widely encouraged by development agencies from the middle of the 1980s in the sahel area of africa
some soils  for example clay  due to lack of water can become consolidated rather than porous  as in the case of sandy soils  some techniques as za  or tillage are then used to still allow the planting of crops
another technique that is useful is contour trenching this involves the digging of 150m long 1m deep trenches in the soil the trenches are made parallel to the height lines of the landscape preventing the water from flowing within the trenches and causing erosion stone walls are placed around the trenches to prevent the trenches from closing up again the method was invented by peter westerveld
enriching of the soil and restoration of its fertility is often done by plants of these the leguminous plants which extract nitrogen from the air and fixes it in the soil and food crops trees as grains barley beans and dates are the most important sand fences can also be used to control drifting of soil and sand erosion
some research centra  such as bel-air research center ird isra ucad  are also experimenting with the inoculation of tree species with mycorrhiza in arid zones the mycorrhiza are basically fungi attaching themselves to the roots of the plants they hereby create a symbiotic relation with the trees increasing the surface area of the tree s roots greatly  allowing the tree to gather much more nutrients from the soil  an example of a promosing setup is jujube combined with glomus aggregatum
as there are many different types of deserts there are also different types of desert reclamation methodologies an example for this is the salt-flats in the rub  al khali desert in saudi-arabia these salt-flats are one of the most promising desert areas for seawater agriculture and could be revitalized without the use of freshwater or much energy
farmer-managed natural regeneration  fmnr  is another technique that has produced successful results for desert reclamation since 1980 this method to reforest degraded landscape has been applied with some success in niger this simple and low-cost method has enabled farmers to regenerate some 30,000 square kilometers in niger the process involves enabling native sprouting tree growth through selective pruning of shrub shoots the residue from pruned trees can be used to provide mulching for fields thus increasing soil water retention and reducing evaporation additionally properly spaced and pruned trees can increase crop yields the humbo assisted regeneration project which uses fmnr techniques in ethiopia has received money from the world bank s biocarbon fund which supports projects that sequester or conserve carbon in forests or agricultural ecosystems
managed grazing
restoring grasslands store co2 from the air into plant material grazing livestock usually not left to wander would eat the grass and would minimize any grass growth while grass left alone would eventually grow to cover its own growing buds preventing them from photosynthesizing and killing the plant a method proposed to restore grasslands uses fences with many small paddocks and moving herds from one paddock to another after a day or two in order to mimick natural grazers and allowing the grass to grow optimally it is estimated that increasing the carbon content of the soils in the world s 3.5 billion hectares of agricultural grassland would offset nearly 12 years of co2 emissions allan savory as part of holistic management claims that while large herds are often blamed for desertification prehistoric lands used to support large or larger herds and areas where herds were removed in the united states are still desertifying
