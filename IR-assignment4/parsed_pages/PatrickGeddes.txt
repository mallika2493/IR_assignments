early influences
patrick geddes was influenced by social theorists such as herbert spencer  1820 1903  and french theorist frederic le play  1806 1882  and expanded upon earlier theoretical developments that led to the concept of regional planning
he adopted spencer s theory that the concept of biological evolution could be applied to explain the evolution of society and drew on le play s analysis of the key units of society as constituting  lieu travail famille    place work family   but changing the last from  family  to  folk  in this theory the family is viewed as the central  biological unit of human society   from which all else develops according to geddes it is from  stable healthy homes  providing the necessary conditions for mental and moral development that come beautiful and healthy children who are able  to fully participate in life 
geddes drew on le play s circular theory of geographical locations presenting environmental limitations and opportunities that in turn determine the nature of work his central argument was that physical geography market economics and anthropology were related yielding a  single chord of social life  all three combined  thus the interdisciplinary subject of sociology was developed into the science of  man s interaction with a natural environment  the basic technique was the regional survey and the improvement of town planning the chief practical application of sociology 
geddes writing demonstrates the influence of these ideas on his theories of the city he saw the city as a series of common interlocking patterns  an inseparably interwoven structure  akin to a flower he criticised the tendency of modern scientific thinking to specialisation in his  report to the hh the maharaja of kapurthala  in 1917 he wrote 
these ideas can also be traced back to geddes  abiding interest in eastern philosophy which he believed more readily conceived of  life as a whole    as a result civic beauty in india has existed at all levels from humble homes and simple shrines to palaces magnificent and temples sublime  
against a backdrop of extraordinary development of new technologies industrialisation and urbanism geddes witnessed the substantial social consequences of crime illness and poverty that developed as a result of modernisation from geddes  perspective the purpose of his theory and understanding of relationships among the units of society was to find an equilibrium among people and the environment to improve such conditions
key ideas
 conservative surgery  versus the gridiron plan
geddes championed a mode of planning that sought to consider  primary human needs  in every intervention engaging in  constructive and conservative surgery  rather than the  heroic all of a piece schemes  popular in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries he continued to use and advocate for this approach throughout his career
very early on in his career geddes demonstrated the practicality of his ideas and approach in 1886 geddes and his newly married wife purchased a row of slum tenements in james court edinburgh making it into a single dwelling in and around this area geddes commenced upon a project of  conservative surgery    weeding out the worst of the houses that surrounded them widening the narrow closes into courtyards  and thus improving sunlight and airflow the best of the houses were kept and restored geddes believed that this approach was both more economical and more humane
in this way geddes consciously worked against the tradition of the  gridiron plan  resurgent in colonial town design in the 19th century 
however he wished this policy of  sweeping clearances  to be recognised for what he believed it was   one of the most disastrous and pernicious blunders in the chequered history of sanitation 
geddes criticised this tradition as much for its  dreary conventionality  as for its failure to address in the long term the very problems it purport to solve according to geddes  analysis this approach was not only  unsparing to the old homes and to the neighbourhood life of the area  but also in  leaving fewer housing sites and these mostly narrower than before  expelling a large population that would  again as usual be driven to create worse congestion in other quarters 
the  observational technique 
drawing on the scientific method geddes encouraged close observation as the way to discover and work with the relationships among place work and folk in 1892 to allow the general public an opportunity to observe these relationships geddes opened a  sociological laboratory  called the outlook tower that documented and visualized the regional landscape in keeping with scientific process and using new technologies geddes developed an index museum to categorise his physical observations and maintained encyclopedia graphicato which utilised a camera obscura to provide an opportunity for the general public to observe their own landscape to witness the relationships among units of society the outlook tower was built in edinburgh s old town and continues to be used as a museum
the  civic survey 
geddes advocated the civic survey as indispensable to urban planning  his motto was  diagnosis before treatment  such a survey should include at a minimum the geology the geography the climate the economic life and the social institutions of the city and region his early work surveying the city of edinburgh became a model for later surveys
he was particularly critical of that form of planning which relied overmuch on design and effect neglecting to consider  the surrounding quarter and constructed without reference to local needs or potentialities  geddes encouraged instead exploration and consideration of the  whole set of existing conditions  studying the  place as it stands seeking out how it has grown to be what it is and recognising alike its advantages its difficulties and its defects  
in this sense he can be viewed as prefiguring the work of seminal urban thinkers such as jane jacobs and region-specific planning movements such as new urbanism encouraging the planner to consider the situation inherent virtue and potential in a given site rather than  an abstract ideal that could be imposed by authority or force from the outside 
the regional plan
in 1909 geddes assisted in the early planning of the southern aspect of the zoological gardens in edinburgh this work was formative in his development of a regional planning model called the  valley section this model illustrated the complex interactions among biogeography geomorphology and human systems and attempted to demonstrate how  natural occupations  such as hunting mining or fishing are supported by physical geographies that in turn determine patterns of human settlement the point of this model was to make clear the complex and interrelated relationships between humans and their environment and to encourage regional planning models that would be responsive to these conditions
work in india
geddes  work in improving the slums of edinburgh led to an invitation from lord pentland  then governor of madras  to travel to india to advise on emerging urban planning issues in particular how to mediate  between the need for public improvement and respect for existing social standards  for this geddes prepared an exhibition on  city and town planning  the materials for the first exhibit were sent to india on a ship that was sunk near madras by the german ship emden however new materials were collected and an exhibit prepared for the senate hall of madras university by 1915
according to some reports this was near the time of the meeting of the indian national congress and pentland hoped the exhibit would demonstrate the benefits of british rule geddes lectured and worked with indian surveyors and travelled to bombay and bengal where pentland s political allies lord willingdon and lord carmichael were governors he held a position in sociology and civics at bombay university from 1919 to 1925
between 1915 and 1919 geddes wrote a series of  exhaustive town planning reports  on at least eighteen indian cities a selection of which has been collected together in jacqueline tyrwhitt s patrick geddes in india  1947 
through these reports geddes was concerned to create a  working system in india  righting the wrongs of the past by making interventions in and plans for the urban fabric that were both considerate of local context and tradition and awake to the need for development according to lewis mumford writing in introduction to tyrwhitt s collected reports 
his principles for town planning in bombay demonstrate his views on the relationship between social processes and spatial form and the intimate and causal connections between the social development of the individual and the cultural and physical environment they included    what town planning means under the bombay town planning act of 1915  
geddes  exhortation to pay attention to the social and particular when attempting city renewal or resettlement remains relevant particularly in light of the plans for slum resettlement and redevelopment ongoing in many indian cities  see eg dharavi redevelopment program  
work in palestine
geddes worked with his son-in-law the architect frank mears on a number of projects in palestine in 1919 he was engaged to prepare a scheme for the hebrew university of jerusalem at the instigation of the psychoanalyst dr david eder who headed the zionist organisation s london branch he also submitted a report on jerusalem actual and possible to the military governor of jerusalem in november 1919 in 1925 he submitted a report on town planning in jaffa and tel aviv to the municipality of tel aviv then led by meir dizengoff the municipality adopted his proposals and tel aviv is the only city whose core is entirely laid out according to a plan by geddes
influence
geddes  ideas had worldwide circulation  his most famous admirer was the american urban theorist lewis mumford who claimed that  geddes was a global thinker in practice a whole generation or more before the western democracies fought a global war 
geddes also influenced several british urban planners  notably raymond unwin and frank mears  the indian social scientist radhakamal mukerjee and the catalan architect cebri  de montoliu  1873 1923  as well as many other 20th century thinkers
geddes was keenly interested in the science of ecology an advocate of nature conservation and strongly opposed to environmental pollution because of this some historians have claimed he was a forerunner of modern green politics
researchers at the geddes institute for urban research at the university of dundee continue to develop geddesian approaches to questions of city and regional planning and questions of social and psychical well-being in the built environment the institute is currently  october to december 2015  staging an exhibition of geddes  work in the university of dundee s lamb gallery drawn from the archives of the universities of dundee strathclyde and edinburgh to mark the centenary of the publication of cities in evolution
