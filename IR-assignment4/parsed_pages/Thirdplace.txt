oldenburg s characteristics
oldenburg calls one s  first place  the home and those that one lives with the  second place  is the workplace   where people may actually spend most of their time third places then are  anchors  of community life and facilitate and foster broader more creative interaction
according to ganguly and bhattacharya oldenburg suggests the following hallmarks of a true  third place  
other scholars have summarized oldenburg view of a third place with a similar eight characteristics 
occupants of third places have little to no obligation to be there they are not tied down to the area financially politically legally or otherwise and are free to come and go as they please
third places put no importance on an individual s status in a society someone s economic or social status do not matter in a third place allowing for a sense of commonality among its occupants there are no prerequisites or requirements that would prevent acceptance or participation in the third place
playful and happy conversation is the main focus of activity in third places although it is not required to be the only activity the tone of conversation is usually light hearted and humorous  wit and good natured playfulness are highly valued
third places must be open and readily accessible to those who occupy them they must also be accommodating meaning they provide the wants of their inhabitants and all occupants feel their needs have been fulfilled
third places harbor a number of regulars that help give the space its tone and help set the mood and characteristics of the area regulars to third places also attract newcomers and are there to help someone new to the space feel welcome and accommodated
third places are characteristically wholesome the inside of a third place is without extravagance or grandiosity and has a homely feel third places are never snobby or pretentious and are accepting of all types of individuals from several different walks of life
the tone of conversation in third places are never marked with tension or hostility instead they have a playful nature where witty conversation and frivolous banter are not only common but highly valued
occupants of third places will often have the same feelings of warmth possession and belonging as they would in their own homes they feel a piece of themselves is rooted in the space and gain spiritual regeneration by spending time there
types of third places
jeffres et al  2009  listed the following types of environments as possible third places considered in their research  community centers senior centers coffee shops and cafes bars and pubs restaurants shopping centers stores malls markets hair salons barber and beauty shops recreation centers ym wca pools movie theaters churches schools colleges and universities clubs and organizations libraries parks and other places allowing for outdoor recreation streets neighbors  yards homes and apartments and events like neighborhood parties block parties cookouts barbecues town meetings bingo and various media  online newsletters newspapers phone bulletin boards 
the concept of a  third place  has become popularized and has been picked up by various small businesses including as a name for various locally owned coffee shops and is commonly cited in urban planning literature on the issue of community-oriented business development and public space
variant forms of the concept include the  community coffee house  and the  community living room  a term which has been adopted by several organizations to describe the model of a cooperatively-run  third space  which includes commercial or non-commercial functions with an emphasis on providing a free space for social interaction
the general store or pub and occasionally bookstore or diner are traditional variants of the concept provided in such cases there is an emphasis on expectation of socialization and customers are invited to stay and  hang out  with or without making any  or additional  purchases institutions which traditionally provided some functions of a third place included shared leisure facilities such as a bowling alley or arcade function halls lodges or social clubs when and if facilities were available for casual use
a church community fills this role for many people including groups that focus on common interests and hobbies activities events and cell groups can build the connections that are necessary for authentic community
virtual third places
since oldenburg s writings there are people in the computer and internet industry that have declared that third places are observed or shifting to the virtual world or virtual third places this descriptive practice is easily adopted because of the similarities in descriptive characteristics found between the virtual and physical worlds
in combination with the industrial revolution and as media transitioned from the public space to more comfortable roles inside one s home there was a large shift away from public activities because they could be enjoyed within the confines of one s home with the advent of online technologies these virtual third places have been observed in online communities the characteristics observed in these communities vary from their physical application but meet the context of personalization permeability approachability and comfortability
with the increasing popularity of online multiplayer video games individuals from across the world are becoming more connected with each other through these video games the potential for social culture clashes is inherently high considering the large volume of interactions of users from different cultures however the online virtual communities constructed within these games share the same characteristics with traditional third places one of the more prominent features of these communities is the social equalizing aspect these games allow users to interact through their in-game character or avatar which serve as a medium for the player and removes the players s social identifiers avatars often interact via built-in text chat systems allowing users to communicate without revealing their identity through their voice therefore any type of social identification is dependent upon the avatar not the actual player
while these online communities provide freedom from traditional social status that is not to say there are no social hierarchies within the games  each game community constructs their own social norms that determine in-game social status however each player begins the game at an equal footing and must achieve social recognition through their in-game accomplishments the concept of  regulars  within third spaces is also prominent in online gaming communities these regulars are often identifiable through some type of special identifier  some games include special insignia or titles for accomplished users making these users stand out to all users the regulars set standards for accepted in-game behavior serving as a type of social moderator  especially for new players  for instance many of these games offer the opportunity for pvp  player vs player  combat in which users battle against each other however this creates an opportunity for users to  grief  one another which is intentional harassment meant to disrupt gameplay for other users this type of behavior is often kept in check by the community regulars  regular  status is attainable for all users which furthers the sense of community within the game as users play more they are accepted into the community by fellow regulars forming new social bonds
as online technologies advance these online video games become more accessible to individuals across all backgrounds while these games are often played on traditional video game consoles or on pcs  which often requires purchasing the video game software  there are many internet browser based games  such as runescape and farmville  that allow anyone with internet access to play for free this widens the variety of individuals that are entering into the community
internet access and third places
an increasing percentage of american workers now telecommute not from home but from a third place workers cite isolation when telecommuting from home and find working in public spaces a happy medium between the home office and the corporate office availability of public wifi has been a major enabler of this trend and an increasing number of retail chains are catering to it
a third place which provides internet access may create a hollow effect in that the patrons are physically present but do not make social contact with each other being absorbed by their remote connections this is similar to how patrons behave in learning commons environments like those in university libraries where the preponderance of socializing is among people who already know each other some businesses like the third place coffeehouse in arlington va are trying to ameliorate this effect by staging performance art such as live jazz and hosting game nights to encourage audience engagement
postmodern conception
political geographer and urban planner edward soja also developed a theory of thirdspace in his 1996 book thirdspace  journeys to los angeles and other real-and-imagined places his postmodern conception draws on and is influenced by henri lefebvre michel foucault and postcolonial thinkers gayatri chakravorty spivak bell hooks edward said and homi k bhabha soja s concept of thirdspace  breaks the firstspace-secondspace dualism and comprises such related concepts as  place location locality landscape environment home city region territory and geography   50  that attempts to come to terms with the representational strategies of real and imagined places he proposes a  trialectics of spatiality   57  which is a process a dynamic force and  recombinational and radically open   50
