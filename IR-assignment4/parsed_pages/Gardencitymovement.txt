garden city movement - wikipedia
the garden city movement is a method of urban planning that was initiated in 1898 by sir ebenezer howard in the united kingdom garden cities were intended to be planned self-contained communities surrounded by  greenbelts  containing proportionate areas of residences industry and agriculture
inspired by the utopian novel looking backward and henry george s work progress and poverty howard published his book to-morrow  a peaceful path to real reform in 1898  which was reissued in 1902 as garden cities of to-morrow  his idealised garden city would house 32,000 people on a site of 6,000 acres  2,400 ha  planned on a concentric pattern with open spaces public parks and six radial boulevards 120 ft  37 m  wide extending from the centre the garden city would be self-sufficient and when it reached full population another garden city would be developed nearby howard envisaged a cluster of several garden cities as satellites of a central city of 58,000 people linked by road and rail


early development
howard s to-morrow  a peaceful path to real reform sold enough copies to result in a second edition garden cities of to-morrow this success provided him the support necessary to pursue the chance to bring his vision into reality howard believed that all people agreed the overcrowding and deterioration of cities was one of the troubling issues of their time he quotes a number of respected thinkers and their disdain of cities howard s garden city concept combined the town and country in order to provide the working class an alternative to working on farms or  crowded unhealthy cities 
to build a garden city howard needed money to buy land he decided to get funding from  gentlemen of responsible position and undoubted probity and honour  he founded the garden city association  later known as the town and country planning association or tcpa  which created first garden city ltd in 1899 to create the garden city of letchworth however these donors would collect interest on their investment if the garden city generated profits through rents or as fishman calls the process  philanthropic land speculation  howard tried to include working class cooperative organisations which included over two million members but could not win their financial support because he had to rely only on the wealthy investors of first garden city howard had to make concessions to his plan such as eliminating the cooperative ownership scheme with no landlords short-term rent increases and hiring architects who did not agree with his rigid design plans
in 1904 raymond unwin a noted architect and town planner along with his partner barry parker won the competition run by first garden city ltd to plan letchworth an area 34 miles outside london unwin and parker planned the town in the centre of the letchworth estate with howard s large agricultural greenbelt surrounding the town and they shared howard s notion that the working class deserved better and more affordable housing however the architects ignored howard s symmetric design instead replacing it with a more  organic  design
letchworth slowly attracted more residents because it was able to attract manufacturers through low taxes low rents and more space despite howard s best efforts the home prices in this garden city could not remain affordable for blue-collar workers to live in the populations comprised mostly skilled middle class workers after a decade the first garden city became profitable and started paying dividends to its investors although many viewed letchworth as a success it did not immediately inspire government investment into the next line of garden cities
in reference to the lack of government support for garden cities frederic james osborn a colleague of howard and his eventual successor at the garden city association recalled him saying  the only way to get anything done is to do it yourself  likely in frustration howard bought land at welwyn to house the second garden city in 1919 the purchase was at auction with money howard desperately and successfully borrowed from friends the welwyn garden city corporation was formed to oversee the construction but welwyn did not become self-sustaining because it was only 20 miles from london
even until the end of the 1930s letchworth and welwyn remained as the only existing garden cities however the movement did succeed in emphasizing the need for urban planning policies that eventually led to the new town movement
garden cities
howard organised the garden city association in 1899 two garden cities were built using howard s ideas  letchworth garden city and welwyn garden city both in the county of hertfordshire england united kingdom howard s successor as chairman of the garden city association was sir frederic osborn who extended the movement to regional planning
the concept was adopted again in england after world war ii when the new towns act caused the development of many new communities based on howard s egalitarian ideas
the idea of the garden city was influential in the united states examples are  residence park in new rochelle new york  woodbourne in boston  newport news virginia s hilton village  pittsburgh s chatham village  garden city new york  sunnyside queens  jackson heights queens  forest hills gardens also in the borough of queens new york  radburn new jersey  greenbelt maryland  buckingham in arlington county virginia  the lake vista neighborhood in new orleans  norris tennessee  baldwin hills village in los angeles  and the cleveland suburbs of parma and shaker heights
greendale wisconsin is one of three  greenbelt  towns planned beginning in 1935 under the direction of rexford guy tugwell head of the united states resettlement administration under authority of the emergency relief appropriation act the two other greenbelt towns are greenbelt maryland  near washington dc  and greenhills ohio  near cincinnati  the greenbelt towns not only provided work and affordable housing but also served as a laboratory for experiments in innovative urban planning greendale s plan was designed between 1936 and 1937 by a staff headed by joseph crane elbert peets harry bentley and walter c thomas for a site that had formerly consisted of 3,400 acres  14 km2  of farmland
in canada the ontario towns of don mills  now incorporated into the city of toronto  and walkerville are in part garden cities as well as the montreal suburb of mount royal the historic townsite of powell river british columbia and the hydrostone district of halifax nova scotia are recognized as national historic sites of canada built upon the garden city movement in montreal la cit -jardin du tricentenaire is a classic form of garden city located near the olympic stadium all streets are cul-de-sacs and are linked via pedestrian paths to the community park
in peru there is a long tradition in urban design that has been reintroduced in its architecture more recently in 1966 the  residencial san felipe  in the district of jesus maria  lima  was built using the garden city concept
in s o paulo brazil several neighbourhoods were planned as garden cities such as jardim am rica jardim europa alto da lapa alto de pinheiros jardim da sa de and cidade jardim  garden city in portuguese  goi nia capital of goi s state and maring  are examples of garden city
in argentina an example is ciudad jard n lomas del palomar declared by the influential argentinian professor of engineering carlos mar a della paolera founder of  d a mundial del urbanismo   world urbanism day  as the first garden city in south america
in australia the suburb of colonel light gardens in adelaide south australia was designed according to garden city principles so too the town of sunshine which is now a suburb of melbourne in victoria and the suburb of lalor also in melbourne victoria australia the peter lalor estate in lalor takes its name from a leader of the eureka stockade and remains today in its original form however it is under threat from developers and whittlesea council lalor peter lalor home building cooperative 1946-2012 scollay moira pre-dating these was the garden suburb of haberfield in 1901 by richard stanton organised on a vertical integrated model from land subdivision mortgage financing house and interior designs and site landscaping
garden city ideals were employed in the original town planning of christchurch new zealand prior to the earthquakes of 2010 and 2011 the city infrastructure and homes were well integrated into green spaces the rebuild blueprint rethought the garden city concept and how it would best suit the city greenbelts and urban greenspaces have been redesigned to incorporate more living spaces
garden city principles greatly influenced the design of colonial and post-colonial capitals during the early part of the 20th century this is the case for new delhi  designed as the new capital of british india after world war i  of canberra  capital of australia established in 1913  and of quezon city  established in 1939 capital of the philippines from 1948 76  the garden city model was also applied to many colonial hill stations such as da lat in vietnam  est 1907  and ifrane in morocco  est 1929 
in bhutan s capital city thimphu the new plan following the principles of intelligent urbanism is an organic response to the fragile ecology using sustainable concepts it is a contemporary response to the garden city concept
the garden city movement also influenced the scottish urbanist sir patrick geddes in the planning of tel aviv israel in the 1920s during the british mandate for palestine geddes started his tel aviv plan in 1925 and submitted the final version in 1927 so all growth of this garden city during the 1930s was merely  based  on the geddes plan changes were inevitable
the garden city movement was even able to take root in south africa with the development of the suburb of pinelands in cape town
in italy the ina-casa plan - a national public housing plan from the 1950s and  60s - designed several suburbs according to garden city principles  examples are found in many cities and towns of the country such as the isolotto suburb in florence falchera in turin harar in milan cesate villaggio in cesate  part of the metropolitan city of milan  etc
in the former czechoslovakia all industrial cities founded or reconstructed by the bata shoes company  zl n svit partiz nske  were at least influenced by the conception of the garden city
the epcot center in bay lake florida took some influence from howard s garden city concept while the park was still under construction
garden suburbs
the concept of garden cities is to produce relatively economically independent cities with short commute times and the preservation of the countryside garden suburbs arguably do the opposite garden suburbs are built on the outskirts of large cities with no sections of industry they are therefore dependent on reliable transport allowing workers to commute into the city lewis mumford one of howard s disciples explained the difference as  the garden city as howard defined it is not a suburb but the antithesis of a suburb  not a rural retreat but a more integrated foundation for an effective urban life 
the planned garden suburb emerged in the late 18th century as a by-product of new types of transportation were embraced by a newly prosperous merchant class the first garden villages were built by english estate owners who wanted to relocate or rebuild villages on their lands it was in these cases that architects first began designing small houses early examples include harewood and milton abbas major innovations that defined early garden suburbs and subsequent suburban town planning include linking villa-like homes with landscaped public spaces and roads
despite the emergence of the garden suburb in england the typology flowered in the second half of the 19th century in united states there were generally two garden suburb typologies the garden village and the garden enclave the garden villages are spatially independent of the city but remain connected to the city by railroads streetcars and later automobiles the villages often included shops and civic buildings in contrast garden enclaves are typically strictly residential and emphasize natural and private space instead of public and community space the urban form of the enclaves were often coordinated through the use of early land use controls typical of modern zoning including controlled setbacks landscaping materials
garden suburbs were not part of howard s plan and were actually a hindrance to garden city planning they were in fact almost the antithesis of howard s plan what he tried to prevent the suburbanisation of london was an increasing problem which howard attempted to solve with his garden city model which attempted to end urban sprawl by the sheer inhibition of land speculation due to the land being held in trust and the inclusion of agricultural areas on the city outskirts
raymond unwin one of howard s early collaborators on the letchworth garden city project in 1907 became very influential in formalizing the garden city principles in the design of suburbs through his work town planning in practice  an introduction to the art of designing cities and suburbs  1909   the book strongly influenced the housing and town planning act of 1909 which provided municipalities the power to develop urban plans for new suburban communities
smaller developments were also inspired by the garden city philosophy and were modified to allow for residential  garden suburbs  without the commercial and industrial components of the garden city they were built on the outskirts of cities in rural settings some notable examples being in london hampstead garden suburb the sutton garden suburb in benhilton sutton pinner s pinnerwood conversation area and the  exhibition estate  in gidea park and in liverpool wavertree garden suburb the gidea park estate in particular was built during two main periods of activity 1911 and 1934 both resulted in some good examples of domestic architecture by such architects as wells coates and berthold lubetkin thanks to such strongly conservative local residents  associations as the civic society both hampstead and gidea park retain much of their original character
however it is important to note bournville village trust in sw birmingham uk this important residential development was associated with the growth of  cadbury s factory in a garden  here garden city principles are a fundamental part of the trust s activity there are very tight restrictions applying to the properties here no stonewall cladding upvc windows and so-on
howard s influence reached as far as mexico city where architect jos  luis cuevas was influenced by the garden city concept in the design of two of the most iconic inner-city subdivisions colonia hip dromo de la condesa  1926  and lomas de chapultepec  1928-9  
the subdivisions were based on the principles of the garden city as promoted by ebenezer howard including ample parks and other open spaces park islands in the middle of  grand avenues  such as avenida amsterdam in colonia hip dromo one unique example of a garden suburb is the humberstone garden suburb in the united kingdom by the humberstone anchor tenants  association in leicestershire and it is the only garden suburb ever to be built by the members of a workers  co-operative  it remains intact to the present in 1887 the workers of the anchor shoe company in humberstone formed a workers  cooperative and built 97 houses
american architects and partners walter burley griffin and marion mahony griffin were proponents of the movement and after their arrival in australia to design the national capital canberra they produced a number of garden suburb estates most notably at eaglemont with the glenard and mount eagle estates and the ranelagh and milleara estates in victoria
criticisms
while garden cities were praised for being an alternative to overcrowded and industrial cities along with greater sustainability garden cities were often criticized for damaging the economy being destructive of the beauty of nature and being inconvenient according to a trystan edwards garden cities lead to desecration of the country side by trying to recreate country side houses that could spread themselves  however this wasn t a possible feat due to the limited space they had
more recently the environmental movement s embrace of urban density has offered an  implicit critique  of the garden city movement in this way the critique of the concept resembles critiques of other suburbanization models though author stephen ward has argued that critics often do not adequately distinguish between true garden cities and more mundane dormitory city plans
it is often referred to as an urban design experiment which is typified by failure due to the laneways used as common entries and exits to the houses helping ghettoise communities and encourage crime  it has ultimately lead to efforts to  de-radburn  or partially demolish american radburn designed public housing areas
when interviewed in 1998 the architect responsible for introducing the design to public housing in new south wales philip cox was reported to have admitted with regards to an american radburn designed estate in the suburb of villawood  everything that could go wrong in a society went wrong   it became the centre of drugs it became the centre of violence and eventually the police refused to go into it it was hell 
legacy
contemporary town-planning charters like new urbanism and principles of intelligent urbanism originated with this movement today there are many garden cities in the world but most of them have devolved to dormitory suburbs which completely differ from what howard aimed to create
in 2007 the town and country planning association marked its 108th anniversary by calling for garden city and garden suburb principles to be applied to the present new towns and eco-towns in the united kingdom the campaign continued in 2013 with the publication in march of that year of  creating garden cities and suburbs today - a guide for councils  also in 2013 lord simon wolfson announced that he would award the wolfson economics prize for the best ideas on how to create a new garden city
in 2014 the letchworth declaration was published which called for a body to accredit future garden cities in the uk the declaration has a strong focus on the visible  architecture and layout  and the invisible  social ownership and governance  architecture of a settlement one result was the creation of the new garden cities alliance as a community interest company its aim is to be complementary to groups like the town and country planning association and it has adopted tcpa garden city principles as well as those from other groups including those from cabannes ross booklet 21st century garden cities of to-morrow
new garden cities   towns
british chancellor of the exchequer george osborne announced plans for a new garden city to be built at ebbsfleet valley kent in early 2014 with a second also planned as an expansion of bicester oxfordshire the united kingdom government announced further plans for garden towns in 2015 supporting both the development of new communities in north essex and support for sustainable and environmentally-friendly town development in didcot oxfordshire a  black country garden city  was announced in 2016 with plans to build 45,000 new homes in the west midlands
