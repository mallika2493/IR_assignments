facilitation
the un global compact is not a regulatory instrument but rather a forum for discussion and a network for communication including governments companies and labour organisations whose actions it seeks to influence and civil society organizations representing its stakeholders the un global compact says that once companies declared their support for the principles  his does not mean that the global compact recognizes or certifies that these companies have fulfilled the compact s principles  instead as mentioned in a 2015 interview with executive director lise kingo  we are the guide dogs not the watchdogs  with the organization seeking to prioritize providing resources and support instead of attempting to enforce discipline
the un global compact s goals are intentionally flexible and vague but it distinguishes the following channels through which it provides facilitation and encourages dialogue  policy dialogues learning local networks and projects given recent climate talks and summits the un global compact stands to play a critical role in helping signatories and governments work in part to achieve the sdgs recent studies indicate that businesses are more open than ever to private sector interventions such as carbon pricing and other mechanics to help curb climate effects within the scope of business solutions the global compact also will periodically create resources and guides that business and non profit organizations may use in their efforts to support the compact s overall mission one such example is the sdg compass developed in collaboration with the global reporting initiative  gri  and world business council for sustainable development  wbscd  which is a collection of resources  analysis of the goals indicators for businesses tools for stakeholders  that companies can utilize in finding out their role in helping to achieve the sdgs

un global compact   cities programme
in 2001 the city of melbourne proposed that cities as well as corporations should be allowed to join the un global compact arguing that this would provide a clear statement of a city s commitment to positive change as well as motivating participation in international dialogue the proposal was accepted and the un global compact - cities programme was launched in 2002 it was formed as an urban-focused component of the global compact with its international secretariat initially located in melbourne australia the aim of the programme is to improve urban life in cities throughout the world
melbourne became the first city to engage the global compact in june 2001 there are as of 2016 over 130 member cities in the programme
in april 2003 under the directorship of david teller a framework called the melbourne model was developed that went beyond the ten principles it begins by drawing the resources of government business and civil society into a cross-sector partnership in order to develop a practical project that addresses a seemingly intractable urban issue in 2007 the then director paul james  2007 2014  and his colleagues dr andy scerri and dr liam magee took this methodology further by integrating the partnership model with a four-domain sustainability framework called  circles of sustainability 
in 2007 the secretariat moved from the committee for melbourne to the global cities institute at rmit university itself affiliated with un-habitat there projects associated with city-based responses to global climate change and globalization became increasingly important the melbourne model was further elaborated with a sustainability indicators program developed as a way of assessing and monitoring progress in 2012 the circles of sustainability method was elaborated to guide a city or urban region through a rigorous assessment process as one of the outcomes it provides a figurative image of the overall sustainability of that city to illustrate its strengths and weaknesses
in 2015 rmit professor ralph horne became the third director of the un global compact cities programme and in february 2016 an urban thinkers campus was organised at rmit melbourne in collaboration with world vision international as part of the buildup to un habitat iii the theme of the urban thinkers campus was ethical cities  locking in liveability this was followed by the organisation of a urban innovation forum on ethical cities in july 2016 in barcelona spain as a collaboration between the un global compact - cities programme rmit europe and un-habitat
