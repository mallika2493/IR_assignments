ethnobotany - wikipedia
ethnobotany  from ethnology study of culture and botany study of plants  is the scientific study of the relationships that exist between people and plants
ethnobotanists aim to document describe and explain complex relationships between cultures and  uses of  plants focusing primarily on how plants are used managed and perceived across human societies this includes use for food clothing currency ritual medicine dye construction cosmetics and a lot more richard evans schultes called the  father of ethnobotany  explained the discipline in this way 
as can be seen in the dictionary definition as well as overview studies the field of ethnobotany has expanded to include not only primitive or native peoples and not only a utilitarian relationship but also the relationship between people and plants in the modern setting incorporating cognitive ecological and symbolic aspects
intellectual property rights and benefit-sharing arrangements are important issues in ethnobotany


roots
though the term  ethnobotany  was not coined until 1895 by the us botanist john william harshberger the history of the field begins long before that pythagoreanism which originated in 500 bc included a refusal to eat beans perhaps because of the human relationship of the beans through matter while possibly related to the condition known as favism it is more likely because of magical thinking and a contemporary belief that beans and humans originated from the same matter or because of the beans shape bearing similarity to detain human organs in shape theophrastus the father of botany wrote of plants and people s usage of them in his works in ad 77 the greek surgeon pedanius dioscorides published de materia medica which was a catalog of about 600 plants in the mediterranean it also included information on how the plants were used especially for medicinal purposes this illustrated herbal publication contained information on how and when each plant was gathered whether or not it was poisonous its actual use and whether or not it was edible  it even provided recipes  dioscorides stressed the economic potential of plants for generations scholars learned from this herbal publication but did not commonly venture into the field until after the middle ages due to the inquisition
medieval and renaissance
during the medieval period ethnobotanical studies were commonly found connected with monasticism notable at this time was hildegard von bingen however most botanical knowledge was kept in gardens such as physic gardens attached to hospitals and religious buildings it was thought of in practical use terms for culinary and medical purposes and the ethnographic element was not studied as a modern anthropologist might approach ethnobotany today
in 1542 leonhart fuchs a renaissance botanist and medic led the way back into field research his  de historia stirpium commentarii insignes  cataloged 400 plants native to germany and austria and had employed artists to directly illustrate the plants he had collected rather than using illustrations derived from others  work as had been common until this time
the age of reason
john ray  1686 1704  provided the first definition of  species  in his  historia plantarum   a species is a set of individuals who give rise through reproduction to new individuals similar to themselves in 1753 carl linnaeus published  species plantarum  which included information on about 5,900 plants linnaeus is famous for inventing the binomial method of nomenclature in which all species get a two-part name  genus species  but he also carried out in 1732 a research expedition in scandinavia asking the sami people about their ethnological usage of plants
the age of enlightenment saw a rise in economic botanical exploration alexander von humboldt collected data from the new world and james cook s voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the south pacific at this time major botanical gardens were started for instance the royal botanic gardens kew in 1759 the directors of the gardens sent out gardener-botanist explorers to care for and collect plants to add to their collections
as the 18th century became the 19th ethnobotany saw expeditions undertaken with more colonial aims rather than trade economics such as that of lewis and clarke which recorded both plants and the peoples encountered use of them edward palmer collected material culture artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the north american west  great basin  and mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s through all of this research the field of  aboriginal botany  was established the study of all forms of the vegetable world which aboriginal peoples use for food medicine textiles ornaments and more
as a modern science
the first individual to study the emic perspective of the plant world was a german physician working in sarajevo at the end of 19th century  leopold glueck his published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in bosnia  1896  has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work the term  ethnobotany  was first used by a botanist named john w harshberger in 1895 while he was teaching at the university of pennsylvania
other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous local perspective in the 20th century  matilda coxe stevenson zuni plants  1915   frank cushing zuni foods  1920   keewaydinoquay peschel anishinaabe fungi  1998  and the team approach of wilfred robbins john peabody harrington and barbara freire-marreco tewa pueblo plants  1916 
in the beginning ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful this is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work the botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people s lives on the other hand anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and treated other scientific aspects superficially in the early 20th century botanists and anthropologists better collaborated and the collection of reliable detailed cross-disciplinary data began
beginning in the 20th century the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation this is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany the so-called  father  of this discipline is richard evans schultes even though he did not actually coin the term  ethnobotany  today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills  botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens  anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants  linguistic training at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology syntax and semantics
mark plotkin who studied at harvard university the yale school of forestry and tufts university has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany he completed a handbook for the tirio people of suriname detailing their medicinal plants  tales of a shaman s apprentice  1994   the shaman s apprentice a children s book with lynne cherry  1998   and medicine quest  in search of nature s healing secrets  2000 
plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by south american explorer magazine just after the release of tales of a shaman s apprentice and the imax movie amazonia in the book he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and western forms of medicine 
a great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples but the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders schultes actually apprenticed himself to an amazonian shaman which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship in wind in the blood  mayan healing   chinese medicine by garcia et al the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange cherokee medicine priest david winston describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists
another scholar james w herrick who studied under ethnologist william n fenton in his work iroquois medical ethnobotany  1995  with dean r snow  editor  professor of anthropology at penn state explain that understanding herbal medicines in traditional iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient cosmological belief system their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases it also includes a large compilation of herrick s field work from numerous iroquois authorities of over 450 names uses and preparations of plants for various ailments traditional iroquois practitioners had  and have  a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science
issues
many instances of gender bias have occurred in ethnobotany creating the risk of drawing erroneous conclusions other issues include ethical concerns regarding interactions with indigenous populations and the international society of ethnobiology has created a code of ethics to guide researchers
