in 1933 rouse arrived in baltimore in search of opportunity he was fortunate to find a job parking cars at the st paul garage he later remarked that he got the job even though he could not drive he convinced his foreman to teach him rather than fire him he worked in the garage one year in may 1935 rouse wrote millard tydings who found him a position with the federal housing administration as a clerk specializing in completing fha loans to eastern maryland banks although he had only two years of undergraduate college on his transcript in the 1930s that was enough to qualify for law school he borrowed money in march 1936 from guy hollyday who was a loan officer with the title guarantee and trust company seeking fha loan guarantees and attended classes three nights a week at the university of maryland law school he was hired at age 22 by his mentor hollyday
rouse graduated in 1937 and in 1939 left the fha and became partner with hunter moss at a mortgage banking firm called the moss-rouse company funded by a  20,000 loan from moss s sister which would eventually become the rouse company the company would specialize in fha backed loans and hired churchill g carey from connecticut general with his former company providing loan capital to moss-rouse both moss and rouse served during wwii with moss joining the marines and rouse the navy rouse was able to defer duty while his wife was pregnant shipping out to hawaii to work on john henry towers staff on 4 july 1942 rouse returned from the war to put his gambling assets to work with moss in 1952 moss would leave the firm after rouse brought in his brother bill as vice president rouse would make new connections that year crossing party lines as a board member of  democrats for eisenhower 
after world war ii he co-founded the citizens housing and planning association and became involved in baltimore maryland s efforts to rehabilitate its decayed housing stock for profit through the baltimore plan the national publicity of this program led to his participation in dwight d eisenhower s national housing task force starting in 1953 he introduced  or at least helped popularize  the term  urban renewal  to describe the series of recommendations made by that task force
shopping malls
in 1958 rouse built harundale mall in glen burnie maryland the first enclosed shopping center east of the mississippi river and the first built by a real estate developer his company used the term  mall  to describe the development which was an alternative to the more typical strip malls usually built in the suburbs  the  mall  in  strip mall  came into usage later after the enclosed mall had been popularized by rouse s company  although many now attribute the rise of the shopping mall to the decline of the american downtown core rouse s focus at the time was on the introduction of malls as a form of town center for the suburbs
his company became an active developer and manager of shopping center and mall properties even as he shifted focus to new projects which eventually included planned communities and festival marketplaces
harundale mall has been replaced by harundale plaza in 1999 the mall reopened and redeveloped as harundale plaza a strip shopping center stores include aj wright a super fresh supermarket outback steakhouse hollywood video burlington coat factory and a us post office along with several other typical strip-mall stores the signature  rock  from harundale mall is now at harundale plaza
planned communities
in the 1960s rouse turned his focus to planned communities after engaging in a planning exercise for the pocatinco hills estate of the rockefellers rouse constructed his first planned residential development  the village of cross keys in baltimore on june 16 1961 rouse bought 68 acres  280,000 m2  inside the city from the baltimore country club for  25,000 an acre rouse excitedly proclaimed that this undertaking  will be the largest and potentially most important development in the history of baltimore  rouse hoped that he could bring to the residential field  some of the fresh thinking good taste and high standards which we believe have marked our shopping center developments 
familiar with bad housing in baltimore and washington dc rouse now had an opportunity to demonstrate what housing within a city s borders could be like  there is a real need for residential development  he said  in which there is a strong sense of community  a need to feed into the city some of the atmosphere and pace of the small town and village  a need to create a community which can meet as many as possible of the needs of the people who live there  which can bring these people into natural contact with one another  which can produce out of these relationships a spirit and feeling of neighborliness and a rich sense of belonging to a community  in a city that practiced strict racial segregation rouse intended cross keys to be open to all who could afford to live there the development was a mixture of townhouses garden apartments a high-rise apartment house designed by frank gehry stores grouped around a village square and an office complex by 1970 the village of cross keys had become among the most desirable places to live in the baltimore area
while cross keys was still under construction rouse decided to build a whole new city the creation of columbia maryland between baltimore and washington dc was the greatest adventure of rouse s life columbia was the ultimate opportunity  the chance to embody his ideals in a whole new city for the undertaking that would become columbia rouse turned to his partner in previous projects the connecticut general life insurance company   cg   at a meeting at company headquarters in hartford rouse made his pitch to cg s top real estate and mortgage people and the company s chairman of the board frazar b wilde the questioning was mostly negative until wilde joined in he expressed the view that cg couldn t lose if rouse s project did not succeed the land could always be sold and probably for a higher price than what it cost
the land for the new city would be owned by a subsidiary called howard research and development corporation cg would own half of that corporation and rouse s corporation the other half rouse would be responsible for the management of the acquired land and for preparing a master plan for development cg also put up some of the money for columbia s infrastructure the rest was supplied by teachers insurance and annuity association and the chase manhattan bank
by the end of the summer of 1963 close to 14,000 acres  57 km2  of howard county farmland had been acquired and the time was at hand to begin planning what to do with it rouse wanted to hear from a wide assortment of experts and scholars he brought together an assemblage which became known as  the work group  it consisted of top people in health family life education recreation government transportation and employment ultimately emerging was the idea that the new city should be a real multi-faceted city not a bedroom suburb it should be possible for its residents to find everything they needed right there jobs education recreation health care and any other necessity
rouse was not reluctant to bring up his home town of easton as a model for columbia consensus formed around the idea that the basic subdivision within the new city should be the village a unit of from 10,000-15,000 people this number was thought to be the most likely to foster a local feeling of identification  for merchants to get to know their customers ministers their memberships and teachers their pupils and parents
within the city there would be 12 villages each village would have a central gathering place where people of different income levels and types of housing would cross paths and mix each village would have a middle school and a high school a teen center a supermarket a library a hospital an auditorium offices restaurants some specialty shops and a few larger recreational facilities it also would have a multi-denominational house of worship known as an  interfaith center  based on the gordon cosby s ecumenical church of the savior called the kittamaqundi community the hope was that one building would be used by several religions
in addition to the villages there would be a core area that would function as the new city s  downtown  in it would be the central office of the city s governing body the columbia association here would be the main cluster of retail stores  arranged as a mall  a hotel and conference center a hospital movie theaters and a concert hall a community college and branches of the maryland institute college of art and the peabody conservatory of music
the main entertainment area was to be known as tivoli after the entertainment area in copenhagen early on rouse said that he hoped tivoli would be a place  where under the benign influence of having fun and relaxing in familiar ways people would have opportunities especially attractively and conveniently presented for discovering new ways to enjoy their free time new foods new visual and tactile aesthetic experiences even new social relations  rouse wanted the town center in columbia to provide the most comprehensive range of recreational activities and services that had ever been contemplated in a new town
in late 1973 the columbia project took a downturn as maryland land developers such as joel kline and politicians such as governor marvin mandel and vice president spiro agnew were indicted on various charges of corruption related to land speculation rouse was indicted on board of elections charges for donating over the limits toward mandel s 1974 campaign but had charges dropped because the charges were tried just outside the one year limit
festival marketplaces
starting in the mid-1970s and continuing into the 1980s rouse shifted focus to what he ended up calling the  festival marketplace  of which the faneuil hall marketplace was the first and most successful example completed in 1976 the faneuil hall marketplace  comprising quincy market and other spaces adjacent to boston s faneuil hall  was designed by architect benjamin c thompson and was a financial success an act of historic preservation and an anchor for urban revitalization however at its inception it was considered a highly risky venture and many critics felt it was doomed to fail rouse s innovative business vision looked obvious in retrospect but it was a bold contrarian move with few supporters at the outset
other examples of rouse company  festival marketplace  developments include south street seaport in new york city the gallery at market east in philadelphia harborplace in baltimore st louis union station in st louis downtown portland s pioneer place and the riverwalk marketplace of new orleans the early festival marketplaces like faneuil hall and harborplace led time magazine to dub rouse  the man who made cities fun again 
retirement
