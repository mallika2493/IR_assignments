an urban culture is evident in the mature phase of indus valley civilization which thrived in present-day pakistan and north western india from around 3300 bc the quality of municipal city planning suggests knowledge of urban planning and efficient municipal governments which placed a high priority on hygiene the streets of major cities in present-day pakistan such as mohenjo-daro and harappa the world s earliest planned cities were laid out in a perfect grid pattern comparable to that of present-day new york city the houses were protected from noise odours and thieves
as seen in the ancient sites of harappa and mohenjo-daro in pakistan and western border of india this urban plan included the world s first urban sanitation systems within the city individual homes or groups of homes obtained water from wells from a room that appears to have been set aside for bathing waste water was directed to covered drains which lined the major streets houses opened only to inner courtyards and smaller lanes
the ancient indus systems of sewage and drainage that were developed and used in cities throughout the indus valley were far more advanced than any found in contemporary urban sites in the middle east and even more efficient than those in some areas of modern south asia today the advanced architecture of the harappans is shown by their dockyards granaries warehouses brick platforms and protective walls

poland
four cities stand out as examples of planned communities in poland  zamo   gdynia tychy and nowa huta their very diverse layouts are the result of the different aesthetics that were held as ideal during the development of each of these planned communities planned cities in poland have a long history and fall primarily into three time periods during which planned towns developed in poland and its neighbors that once comprised the polish-lithuanian commonwealth these are the nobleman s republic  16th to 18th centuries  the interwar period  1918 1939  and socialist realism  1944 1956 
the extreme opulence that poland s nobility enjoyed during the renaissance left poland s elites with not only obscene amounts of money to spend but also motivated them to find new ways to invest their hefty fortunes out of the grasp of the royal treasury jan zamoyski founded the city of zamo   in order to circumvent royal tariffs and duties while also serving as the capital for his mini-state zamo   was planned by the renowned paduan architect bernardo morando and modeled on renaissance theories of the  ideal city  realizing the importance of trade zamoyski issued special location charters for representatives of peoples traditionally engaged in trade ie to greeks armenians and sephardic jews and secured exemptions on taxes customs duties and tolls which contributed to its fast development zamoyski s success with zamo   spawned numerous other polish nobles to found their own  private  cities such as bia ystok and many of these towns survive today while zamo   was added to the un world heritage list in 1992 and is today considered one of the most precious urban complexes in europe and in the world
the preeminent example of a planned community in interwar poland is gdynia after world war i when poland regained its independence it lacked a commercial seaport  de iure poles could use gda sk which was the main port of the country before the war and is again today but de facto the germans residing in the city made it almost impossible for them  making it necessary to build one from scratch the extensive and modern seaport facilities in gdynia the most modern and extensive port facilities in europe at the time became poland s central port on the baltic sea in the shadow of the port the city took shape mirroring in its scope the rapid development of 19th-century chicago growing from a small fishing village of 1,300 in 1921 into a full blown city with a population over 126,000 less than 20 years later the central business district that developed in gdynia is a showcase of art deco and modernist architectural styles and predominate much of the cityscape there are also villas particularly in the city s villa districts such as kamienna g ra where historicism inspired neo-renaissance and neo-baroque architecture
after the destruction of most polish cities in world war ii the communist regime that took power in poland sought to bring about architecture that was in line with its vision of society thus urban complexes arose that reflected the ideals of socialist realism this can be seen in districts of polish cities such as warsaw s mdm the city of nowa huta  now a district of krak w  and tychy were built as the epitome of the proletarian future of poland

during the 16th and 17th centuries the population of spain declined due to emigration to the americas and later kings and governments made efforts to repopulate the country in the second half of the 18th century king charles iii implemented the so-called new settlements  nuevas poblaciones  plan which would bring 10,000 immigrants from central europe to the region of sierra morena pablo de olavide was appointed superintendent and about forty new settlements were established of which the most notable was la carolina which has a perfectly rectangular grid design
later kings and repopulation efforts led to the creation of more settlements also with rectangular grid plans one of them was the town of la isabela  40.4295 n 2.6876 w  which disappeared in the 1950s submerged under the waters of the newly created artificial lake of buend a but is still visible just under the water in satellite imagery

the romans planned many towns in britain but the settlements were changed out of all recognition in subsequent centuries the town of winchelsea is said to be the first post-roman new town in britain constructed to a grid system under the instructions of king edward i in 1280 and largely completed by 1292 another claimant to the title is salisbury established in the early 13th century by the then bishop of sarum the best known pre-20th-century new town in the uk was undoubtedly the edinburgh new town built in accordance with a 1766 master plan by james craig and  along with bath and dublin  the archetype of the elegant georgian style of british architecture
the term  new town  often refers in the uk to towns built after world war ii under the new towns act 1946 these were influenced by the garden city movement launched around 1900 by ebenezer howard and sir patrick geddes and the work of raymond unwin and manifested at letchworth garden city and welwyn garden city in hertfordshire
following world war ii some 28 projected towns were designated as new towns under the 1946 act and were developed partly to house the large numbers of people whose homes had been destroyed by bombing during the war and partly to move parts of the population out of  mainly victorian  urban slums new towns policy was also informed by a series of wartime commissions including 
also crucial to thinking was the abercrombie plan for london  1944  which envisaged moving a million and a half people from london to new and expanded towns a similar plan was developed for the clyde valley in 1946 to combat similar problems faced in glasgow together these committees reflected a strong consensus to halt the uncontrolled sprawl of london and other large cities for some this consensus was tied up with a concern for social welfare reform  typified by the beveridge report  as typified in the motto if we can build better we can live better  for others such as john betjeman it was a more conservative objection to the changing character of existing towns
following the building of borehamwood middlesex 12 miles north-west of central london the first in a ring of major  first generation  new towns around london  1946  were stevenage hertfordshire 27 miles to the north of london and basildon essex 25 miles east of london along the river thames hertfordshire built four other new towns two in the vicinity of stevenage  welwyn garden city and hatfield  a third to the north called letchworth and hemel hempstead to the west  hall 1996  133  new towns in the north east were also planned such as newton aycliffe  which the social reformer and government adviser william beveridge wanted to be the  ideal town to live in   and peterlee two new towns were also planned in scotland at east kilbride  1947  and glenrothes  1948  bracknell in berkshire to the south-west of london was designated a new town in 1949 and is still expanding other london new towns from this era include harlow in essex and crawley in west sussex
later a scatter of  second-generation  towns were built to meet specific problems such as the development of the corby steelworks finally five  third-generation  towns were launched in the late 1960s  these were larger some of them based on substantial existing settlements such as peterborough and the most famous was probably milton keynes midway between london and birmingham known for its huge central park and shopping centre designed from the outset as a new city   though in law it is a  new town  the 1960s saw new towns crop up around england s second-city birmingham namely redditch tamworth and telford
other towns such as ashford in kent basingstoke in hampshire and swindon in wiltshire were designated  expanded towns  and share many characteristics with the new towns scotland also gained three more new towns  cumbernauld in 1956 famous for its enclosed  town centre  livingston  1962  and irvine  1966 
in spite of the relative success of new towns in the london metropolitan green belt london continued to suffer from a chronic housing shortage especially in the south-east another small new town thamesmead was developed adjacent to the thames in the early 1960s but suffered from poor transport links some improvement in infrastructure has been seen subsequently
all the new towns featured a car-oriented layout with many roundabouts and a grid-based road system unusual in the old world milton keynes in particular was designed with a grid-based distributor road system the earlier new towns where construction was often rushed and whose inhabitants were generally plucked out of their established communities with little ceremony rapidly got a poor press reputation as the home of  new town blues  these issues were systematically addressed in the later towns with the third generation towns in particular devoting substantial resources to cycle routes public transport and community facilities as well as employing teams of officers for social development work
the financing of the uk new towns was creative land within the designated area was acquired at agricultural use value by the development corporation for each town and infrastructure and building funds borrowed on 60-year terms from the uk treasury interest on these loans was rolled up in the expectation that the growth in land values caused by the development of the town would eventually allow the loans to be repaid in full however the high levels of retail price inflation experienced in the developed world in the 1970s and 1980s fed through into interest rates and frustrated this expectation so that substantial parts of the loans had ultimately to be written off
all new towns designated under the new towns act of 1946 were serviced by a secretariat the new towns association a quango that reported to the new towns directorate of the department of the environment it coordinated the work of the general managers and technical officers published a monthly information bulletin and provided information for visitors from around the world as each new town reached maturity the town s assets were taken over by the commission for new towns set up in 1948 the new towns association was dissolved in 1998 all papers held by it and the commission for new towns are held in the national archives 
from the 1970s the first generation towns began to reach their initial growth targets as they did so their development corporations were wound up and the assets disposed of  rented housing to the local authority and other assets to the commission for the new towns  in england  but alternative arrangements were made in scotland and wales  the thatcher government from 1979 saw the new towns as a socialist experiment to be discontinued and all the development corporations were dissolved by 1992  with the closure of milton keynes development corporation  even for the third generation towns whose growth targets were still far from being achieved ultimately the commission for the new towns was also dissolved and its assets   still including a lot of undeveloped land   passed to the english industrial estates corporation  later known as english partnerships 
many of the new towns attempted to incorporate public art and cultural programmes but with mixed methods and results in harlow the architect in charge of the design of the new town frederick gibberd founded the harlow art trust and used it to purchase works by leading sculptors including auguste rodin henry moore and barbara hepworth in peterlee the abstract artist victor pasmore was appointed part of the design team which led to the building of the apollo pavilion washington new town was provided with a community theatre and art gallery the public art in milton keynes includes the  in famous concrete cows which resulted from the work of an  artist in residence  and have gone on to become a recognised landmark glenrothes led the way in scotland being the first new town to appoint a town artist in 1968 a massive range of artworks  around 132 in total  ranging from concrete hippos to bronze statues dancing children giant flowers a dinosaur a horse and chariot and crocodiles to name but a few were created town artists appointed in glenrothes include david harding and malcolm robertson
in the 1990s an experimental  new town  was developed by the prince of wales to use very traditional or vernacular architectural styles was started at poundbury in dorset
in northern ireland building of craigavon in county armagh commenced in 1966 between lurgan and portadown although entire blocks of flats and shops lay empty and later derelict before eventually being bulldozed the area which now has a population exceeding 80,000 is mostly a dormitory town for belfast
derry was the first ever planned city in ireland  the city is now located in northern ireland  work began on building the new city across the river foyle from the ancient town of derry  doire cholm chille or doire  in 1613 the walls were actually completed five years later in 1618 the central diamond within a walled city with four gates was thought to be a good design for defence in 1963 under the matthew plan the new city of craigavon was founded out of the original towns of portadown and lurgan this town today lies mostly incomplete as the troubles halted construction the plan initially was to construct a relief settlement to take people out of the crowded city of belfast
in the late 1950s and early 1960s scotland saw a creation of several  post-war new towns  these were  cumbernauld east kilbride glenrothes irvine and livingston each of these towns are in scotland s list of 20 most populated towns and cities east kilbride is the second largest town in scotland or the 6th largest settlement with a population of over 73,000 and livingston with a population of 76,000 the other three towns are not as big with populations between 30,000 and 50,000

canada
when prime minister sir john a macdonald began to settle the west in canada he put the project under the command of the canadian pacific railway  cpr  the cpr exercised complete control over the development of land under its ownership the federal government granted every second square mile section  totalling 101,000 km   along the proposed railway line route to the cpr the cpr decided where to place railway stations and thus would decide where the dominant town of the area would be in most instances the cpr would build a station on an empty section of land to make the largest profit from land sales   meaning that the cpr founded many of the canadian west s towns such as medicine hat and moose jaw from scratch if an existing town was close to the newly constructed station but on land not owned by the cpr the town was forced to move itself to the new site and reconstruct itself essentially building a new town calgary and yorkton saskatchewan were among the towns that had to move themselves
after the cpr established a station at a particular site it would plan how the town would be constructed the side of the tracks with the station would go to business while the other side would go to warehouses furthermore the cpr controlled where major buildings went  by giving the town free land to build it where the cpr wanted it to go  the construction of roads and the placement and organization of class-structured residential areas
the cpr s influence over the development of the canadian west s communities was one of the earliest examples of new town construction in the modern world later influences on planned community development in canada were the exploitation of mineral and forest wealth usually in remote locations of the vast country among numerous company towns planned and built for these purposes were corner brook and grand falls in newfoundland t miscaming and fermont in quebec
in the modern suburban context several  new towns  were established in the suburbs of large cities early examples include leaside in toronto and mount royal in montreal both were planned and developed by the canadian northern railway as middle class suburbs though both leaside in particular featured large industrial tracts leaside had its own municipal government until 1967 while mount royal continues to enjoy autonomy from the city of montreal
in the post-war period new corporate new towns were developed bramalea located in brampton ontario and erin mills located in mississauga ontario were both developed in phases both included residential commercial and industrial components development in erin mills continues to this day

panama
although panama city itself is not planned certain areas are such as costa del este an exclusive high density residential and business area very close to downtown panama city the project combines many skyscrapers with beautiful green areas and it is close to a highway that connects it to the city center other planned areas but in a lesser degree are punta pacifica and the former canal zone

the levittowns in long island pennsylvania and new jersey  now known as willingboro new jersey    typified the planned suburban communities of the 1950s and early 1960s california s rohnert park  north of san francisco  is another example of a planned city  built at the same time as levittown  that was marketed to attract middle-class people into an area only populated with farmers with the phrase  a country club for the middle class 
many other places such as orange county california the conejo valley in ventura county valencia in los angeles county as well as phoenix arizona and northern arizona also have many master planned communities following the housing boom in the 1960s which is when the fathers of scottsdale arizona foresaw a huge amount of growth in arizona some of those communities include anaheim hills rossmoor irvine ladera ranch laguna niguel mission viejo and talega thousand oaks westlake village newbury park valencia in california and  in the phoenix area  marley park talking rock ranch mccormick ranch rio verde tartesso and verrado in buckeye arizona the neighborhood of warren in the city of bisbee has the distinction of being arizona s first planned community in the conejo valley which is the in east county area of ventura county all cities were master planned most notably the thousand oaks newbury park and westlake village area was master planned by the janss investment company which was also responsible for the development of westwood village part of the westside in los angeles valencia is an area that is a master planned community that incorporated into the city of santa clarita developed and planned by the newhall land and farming company about 25  of orange county is composed of various master planned communities much of which was done by the irvine company and since 1990 85  of all developments in orange county and a slightly smaller amount of communities in arizona were part of a master planned community 75  of all resales today in the phoenix area are homes in master planned communities and 80  of all new home construction permits issued by arizona building departments are master planned communities these communities provide functionality to the precious land left in the area as well as the ability to create a housing-business-transportation-open space balance
the era of the modern planned city began in 1962 64 with the creation of reston virginia which was begun just a year before coral springs in western broward county florida and columbia maryland in more recent years new urbanism has set the stage for new cities with places like the idyllic seaside florida and disney s new town of celebration florida
in the united states suburban growth in the sunbelt states has coincided with the popularity of master planned communities within established suburbs texas was at the forefront of this trend las colinas established in 1973 was one of the first such examples and is still growing las colinas is a 12,000 acres  4,900 ha  master planned community within the dallas-area city of irving in 2006 residents approved changes to deed restrictions to allow greater density of urban mixed-use and residential construction also in the 1970s just north of the existing town of spring texas  north of houston  oil and gas industry executive george p mitchell developed the woodlands a major residential and commercial master planned community which is now considered one of the premier residential and business destinations in the houston area the woodlands is still experiencing huge growth to this day in the 1990s cinco ranch was first developed just south of the existing town of katy one of the western suburbs of houston and has contributed to the explosive recent growth of houston s suburban west side

brazil
bras lia 
juscelino kubitschek president of brazil from 1956 to 1961 ordered the construction of bras lia fulfilling the promise of the constitution and his own political campaign promise building bras lia was part of juscelino s  fifty years of prosperity in five  plan l cio costa won a contest and was the main urban planner in 1957 with 5550 people competing oscar niemeyer a close friend was the chief architect of most public buildings and roberto burle marx was the landscape designer bras lia was built in 41 months from 1956 to april 21 1960 when it was officially inaugurated
the former capital of brazil was rio de janeiro and resources tended to be concentrated in the southeast region of brazil while the city was built because there was a need for a neutrally-located federal capital the main reason was to promote the development of brazil s hinterland and better integrate the entire territory of brazil bras lia is approximately at the geographical center of brazilian territory
l cio costa the city s principal architect designed the city to be shaped like an airplane housing and offices are situated on giant superblocks everything following the original plan the plan specifies which zones are residential which zones are commercial where industries can settle where official buildings can be built the maximum height of buildings etc
belo horizonte

australia
australia s most prominent fully planned city is canberra designed by american architect walter burley griffin the early central areas of two other major capital cities   adelaide and melbourne   were also planned by surveyors walter burley griffin was australia s most notable city planner having also designed smaller cities and towns including leeton and griffith in new south wales a controversial japanese-backed planned city multifunction polis was proposed in the 1980s but never implemented
australia is still building planned communities with developers such as delfin lend lease an s p asx 50 company that has been responsible for large master planned communities such as 
adelaide was founded by british and german colonists in 1836 to test out edward gibbon wakefield s theories of systematic colonisation convict labour was not employed and the colony in theory would be financially self-sufficient  in practice government assistance was used in the early stages land had been sold before anyone set foot in the largely unexplored territory and the city  the basis for the future central business district  was surveyed and planned in a remarkably short space of time adelaide s design has been praised for its four-square layout its choice of setting and its ample parklands which have had minimal encroachment of developments the town centre was in sufficient proximity to a water source the river torrens
melbourne was planned as a free settlement in 1837 through the hoddle grid drawn up by robert hoddle under instructions from george gipps the original plan for melbourne as part of the first land sales  prior to the planning only a handful of existing settlements were built on the fringe of the grid  the grid featured wide parallel streets spanning a gently sloping valley between hills  batman s hill flagstaff hill and eastern hill  and roughly parallel to the course of the yarra river the deliberate exclusion of city squares or open space within the grid was a subject of future frustration for the municipality and residents elizabeth street melbourne in the centre of the grid was built over a gully and has therefore been prone to flooding despite a later extension and later inclusion of planned suburbs melbourne s original plans were not as extensive as adelaide s and the city rapidly outgrew its original boundaries as such it is often not considered to be a planned city but the grid continues to define much of the character of the melbourne city centre
canberra established in 1908 was planned as the capital city of australia and is australia s most notable and ambitious example of civic planning the city was designed to be the federal capital following the federation of the six australian colonies which formed the commonwealth of australia the new nation required a capital that was located away from other major settlements such as melbourne and sydney canberra is thus located in a territory   the australian capital territory   and not a state prior to this time the land that canberra is found on was farming land indigenous settlements and forest in 1912 after an extensive planning competition was completed the vision of american walter burley griffin was chosen as the winning design for the city extensive construction and public works were required to complete the city this involved the flooding of a large parcel of land to form the center piece of the city lake burley griffin unlike some other australian cities the road network suburbs parks and other elements of the city were designed in context with each other rather than haphazard planning as witnessed in much of sydney notable buildings include the high court federal parliament government house war memorial anzac parade and headquarters of the department of defence
