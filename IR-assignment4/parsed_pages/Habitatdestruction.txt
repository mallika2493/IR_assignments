habitat destruction - wikipedia
habitat destruction is the process in which natural habitat is rendered unable to support the species present in this process the organisms that previously used the site are displaced or destroyed reducing biodiversity habitat destruction by human activity is mainly for the purpose of harvesting natural resources for industry production and urbanization clearing habitats for agriculture is the principal cause of habitat destruction other important causes of habitat destruction include mining logging trawling and urban sprawl habitat destruction is currently ranked as the primary cause of species extinction worldwide it is a process of natural environmental change that may be caused by habitat fragmentation geological processes climate change or by human activities such as the introduction of invasive species ecosystem nutrient depletion and other human activities
the terms habitat loss and habitat reduction are also used in a wider sense including loss of habitat from other factors such as water and noise pollution


impacts on organisms
in the simplest term when a habitat is destroyed the plants animals and other organisms that occupied the habitat have a reduced carrying capacity so that populations decline and extinction becomes more likely perhaps the greatest threat to organisms and biodiversity is the process of habitat loss temple  1986  found that 82  of endangered bird species were significantly threatened by habitat loss endemic organisms with limited ranges are most affected by habitat destruction mainly because these organisms are not found anywhere else within the world and thus have less chance of recovering many endemic organisms have very specific requirements for their survival that can only be found within a certain ecosystem resulting in their extinction extinction may also take place very long after the destruction of habitat a phenomenon known as extinction debt habitat destruction can also decrease the range of certain organism populations this can result in the reduction of genetic diversity and perhaps the production of infertile youths as these organisms would have a higher possibility of mating with related organisms within their population or different species one of the most famous examples is the impact upon china s giant panda once found across the nation now it is only found in fragmented and isolated regions in the southwest of the country as a result of widespread deforestation in the 20th century
geography
biodiversity hotspots are chiefly tropical regions that feature high concentrations of endemic species and when all hotspots are combined may contain over half of the world s terrestrial species these hotspots are suffering from habitat loss and destruction most of the natural habitat on islands and in areas of high human population density has already been destroyed  wri 2003  islands suffering extreme habitat destruction include new zealand madagascar the philippines and japan south and east asia   especially china india malaysia indonesia and japan   and many areas in west africa have extremely dense human populations that allow little room for natural habitat marine areas close to highly populated coastal cities also face degradation of their coral reefs or other marine habitat these areas include the eastern coasts of asia and africa northern coasts of south america and the caribbean sea and its associated islands
regions of unsustainable agriculture or unstable governments which may go hand-in-hand typically experience high rates of habitat destruction central america sub-saharan africa and the amazonian tropical rainforest areas of south america are the main regions with unsustainable agricultural practices or government mismanagement
areas of high agricultural output tend to have the highest extent of habitat destruction in the us less than 25  of native vegetation remains in many parts of the east and midwest only 15  of land area remains unmodified by human activities in all of europe
ecosystems
tropical rainforests have received most of the attention concerning the destruction of habitat from the approximately 16 million square kilometers of tropical rainforest habitat that originally existed worldwide less than 9 million square kilometers remain today the current rate of deforestation is 160,000 square kilometers per year which equates to a loss of approximately 1  of original forest habitat each year
other forest ecosystems have suffered as much or more destruction as tropical rainforests farming and logging have severely disturbed at least 94  of temperate broadleaf forests  many old growth forest stands have lost more than 98  of their previous area because of human activities tropical deciduous dry forests are easier to clear and burn and are more suitable for agriculture and cattle ranching than tropical rainforests  consequently less than 0.1  of dry forests in central america s pacific coast and less than 8  in madagascar remain from their original extents
plains and desert areas have been degraded to a lesser extent only 10-20  of the world s drylands which include temperate grasslands savannas and shrublands scrub and deciduous forests have been somewhat degraded but included in that 10-20  of land is the approximately 9 million square kilometers of seasonally dry-lands that humans have converted to deserts through the process of desertification the tallgrass prairies of north america on the other hand have less than 3  of natural habitat remaining that has not been converted to farmland
wetlands and marine areas have endured high levels of habitat destruction more than 50  of wetlands in the us have been destroyed in just the last 200 years between 60  and 70  of european wetlands have been completely destroyed about one-fifth  20   of marine coastal areas have been highly modified by humans one-fifth of coral reefs have also been destroyed and another fifth has been severely degraded by overfishing pollution and invasive species  90  of the philippines  coral reefs alone have been destroyed finally over 35  mangrove ecosystems worldwide have been destroyed
natural causes
habitat destruction through natural processes such as volcanism fire and climate change is well documented in the fossil record one study shows that habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in euramerica 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles
human causes
habitat destruction caused by humans includes land conversion from forests etc to arable land urban sprawl infrastructure development and other anthropogenic changes to the characteristics of land habitat degradation fragmentation and pollution are aspects of habitat destruction caused by humans that do not necessarily involve over destruction of habitat yet result in habitat collapse desertification deforestation and coral reef degradation are specific types of habitat destruction for those areas  deserts forests coral reefs 
geist and lambin  2002  assessed 152 case studies of net losses of tropical forest cover to determine any patterns in the proximate and underlying causes of tropical deforestation their results yielded as percentages of the case studies in which each parameter was a significant factor provide a quantitative prioritization of which proximate and underlying causes were the most significant the proximate causes were clustered into broad categories of agricultural expansion  96   infrastructure expansion  72   and wood extraction  67   therefore according to this study forest conversion to agriculture is the main land use change responsible for tropical deforestation the specific categories reveal further insight into the specific causes of tropical deforestation  transport extension  64   commercial wood extraction  52   permanent cultivation  48   cattle ranching  46   shifting  slash and burn  cultivation  41   subsistence agriculture  40   and fuel wood extraction for domestic use  28   one result is that shifting cultivation is not the primary cause of deforestation in all world regions while transport extension  including the construction of new roads  is the largest single proximate factor responsible for deforestation
drivers
while the above-mentioned activities are the proximal or direct causes of habitat destruction in that they actually destroy habitat this still does not identify why humans destroy habitat the forces that cause humans to destroy habitat are known as drivers of habitat destruction demographic economic sociopolitical scientific and technological and cultural drivers all contribute to habitat destruction
demographic drivers include the expanding human population  rate of population increase over time  spatial distribution of people in a given area  urban versus rural  ecosystem type and country  and the combined effects of poverty age family planning gender and education status of people in certain areas most of the exponential human population growth worldwide is occurring in or close to biodiversity hotspots this may explain why human population density accounts for 87.9  of the variation in numbers of threatened species across 114 countries providing indisputable evidence that people play the largest role in decreasing biodiversity the boom in human population and migration of people into such species-rich regions are making conservation efforts not only more urgent but also more likely to conflict with local human interests the high local population density in such areas is directly correlated to the poverty status of the local people most of whom lacking an education and family planning
from the geist and lambin  2002  study described in the previous section the underlying driving forces were prioritized as follows  with the percent of the 152 cases the factor played a significant role in   economic factors  81   institutional or policy factors  78   technological factors  70   cultural or socio-political factors  66   and demographic factors  61   the main economic factors included commercialization and growth of timber markets  68   which are driven by national and international demands  urban industrial growth  38    low domestic costs for land labor fuel and timber  32    and increases in product prices mainly for cash crops  25   institutional and policy factors included formal pro-deforestation policies on land development  40   economic growth including colonization and infrastructure improvement  34   and subsidies for land-based activities  26    property rights and land-tenure insecurity  44    and policy failures such as corruption lawlessness or mismanagement  42   the main technological factor was the poor application of technology in the wood industry  45   which leads to wasteful logging practices within the broad category of cultural and sociopolitical factors are public attitudes and values  63   individual household behavior  53   public unconcern toward forest environments  43   missing basic values  36   and unconcern by individuals  32   demographic factors were the in-migration of colonizing settlers into sparsely populated forest areas  38   and growing population density   a result of the first factor   in those areas  25  
there are also feedbacks and interactions among the proximate and underlying causes of deforestation that can amplify the process road construction has the largest feedback effect because it interacts with and leads to the establishment of new settlements and more people which causes a growth in wood  logging  and food markets growth in these markets in turn progresses the commercialization of agriculture and logging industries when these industries become commercialized they must become more efficient by utilizing larger or more modern machinery that often are worse on the habitat than traditional farming and logging methods either way more land is cleared more rapidly for commercial markets this common feedback example manifests just how closely related the proximate and underlying causes are to each other
impact on human population
habitat destruction vastly increases an area s vulnerability to natural disasters like flood and drought crop failure spread of disease and water contamination on the other hand a healthy ecosystem with good management practices will reduce the chance of these events happening or will at least mitigate adverse impacts
agricultural land can actually suffer from the destruction of the surrounding landscape over the past 50 years the destruction of habitat surrounding agricultural land has degraded approximately 40  of agricultural land worldwide via erosion salinization compaction nutrient depletion pollution and urbanization humans also lose direct uses of natural habitat when habitat is destroyed aesthetic uses such as birdwatching recreational uses like hunting and fishing and ecotourism usually rely upon virtually undisturbed habitat many people value the complexity of the natural world and are disturbed by the loss of natural habitats and animal or plant species worldwide
probably the most profound impact that habitat destruction has on people is the loss of many valuable ecosystem services habitat destruction has altered nitrogen phosphorus sulfur and carbon cycles which has increased the frequency and severity of acid rain algal blooms and fish kills in rivers and oceans and contributed tremendously to global climate change one ecosystem service whose significance is becoming more realized is climate regulation on a local scale trees provide windbreaks and shade  on a regional scale plant transpiration recycles rainwater and maintains constant annual rainfall  on a global scale plants  especially trees from tropical rainforests  from around the world counter the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere by sequestering carbon dioxide through photosynthesis other ecosystem services that are diminished or lost altogether as a result of habitat destruction include watershed management nitrogen fixation oxygen production pollination waste treatment  ie the breaking down and immobilization of toxic pollutants  and nutrient recycling of sewage or agricultural runoff
the loss of trees from the tropical rainforests alone represents a substantial diminishing of the earth s ability to produce oxygen and use up carbon dioxide these services are becoming even more important as increasing carbon dioxide levels is one of the main contributors to global climate change
the loss of biodiversity may not directly affect humans but the indirect effects of losing many species as well as the diversity of ecosystems in general are enormous when biodiversity is lost the environment loses many species that provide valuable and unique roles to the ecosystem the environment and all its inhabitants rely on biodiversity to recover from extreme environmental conditions when too much biodiversity is lost a catastrophic event such as an earthquake flood or volcanic eruption could cause an ecosystem to crash and humans would obviously suffer from that loss of biodiversity also means that humans are losing animals that could have served as biological control agents and plants that could potentially provide higher-yielding crop varieties pharmaceutical drugs to cure existing or future diseases or cancer and new resistant crop varieties for agricultural species susceptible to pesticide-resistant insects or virulent strains of fungi viruses and bacteria
the negative effects of habitat destruction usually impact rural populations more directly than urban populations across the globe poor people suffer the most when natural habitat is destroyed because less natural habitat means less natural resources per capita yet wealthier people and countries simply have to pay more to continue to receive more than their per capita share of natural resources
another way to view the negative effects of habitat destruction is to look at the opportunity cost of keeping an area undisturbed in other words what are people losing out on by taking away a given habitat  a country may increase its food supply by converting forest land to row-crop agriculture but the value of the same land may be much larger when it can supply natural resources or services such as clean water timber ecotourism or flood regulation and drought control
outlook
the rapid expansion of the global human population is increasing the world s food requirement substantially simple logic instructs that more people will require more food in fact as the world s population increases dramatically agricultural output will need to increase by at least 50  over the next 30 years in the past continually moving to new land and soils provided a boost in food production to appease the global food demand that easy fix will no longer be available however as more than 98  of all land suitable for agriculture is already in use or degraded beyond repair
the impending global food crisis will be a major source of habitat destruction commercial farmers are going to become desperate to produce more food from the same amount of land so they will use more fertilizers and less concern for the environment to meet the market demand others will seek out new land or will convert other land-uses to agriculture agricultural intensification will become widespread at the cost of the environment and its inhabitants species will be pushed out of their habitat either directly by habitat destruction or indirectly by fragmentation degradation or pollution any efforts to protect the world s remaining natural habitat and biodiversity will compete directly with humans  growing demand for natural resources especially new agricultural lands
solutions
in most cases of tropical deforestation three to four underlying causes are driving two to three proximate causes this means that a universal policy for controlling tropical deforestation would not be able to address the unique combination of proximate and underlying causes of deforestation in each country before any local national or international deforestation policies are written and enforced governmental leaders must acquire a detailed understanding of the complex combination of proximate causes and underlying driving forces of deforestation in a given area or country this concept along with many other results about tropical deforestation from the geist and lambin study can easily be applied to habitat destruction in general governmental leaders need to take action by addressing the underlying driving forces rather than merely regulating the proximate causes in a broader sense governmental bodies at a local national and international scale need to emphasize the following
