environmental anthropology - wikipedia
environmental anthropology is a sub-specialty within the field of anthropology that takes an active role in examining the relationships between humans and their environment across space and time


philosophies
adaptation  environment over culture
the sixties was a breakthrough decade for environmental anthropology with functionalism and system theories prevalent throughout the rudiments of the system theories can be seen in marcel mauss  seasonal variation of eskimo echoed later in julian steward s work although later system theories were later harshly criticized for narrowly assuming the state of societies as static
the main focus of system theories in the sixties as conveyed by julian steward was acknowledgment of recurrence cultural patterns or  laws  steward s ecological anthropology was based on topography climate and resources and their accessibility to define culture while marvin harris  cultural materialism observed and gauged social units by means of material production both focused on culture as a malleable contingent to the environment  a social unit s characteristics  technology politics modes of subsistence to name a few  have adaptive limitations importantly those limitations are not considered determinants
diversity history and associations
the new focus of environmental anthropology was cultural variation and diversity such factors like environmental disasters  floods earthquakes frost  migrations cost   benefit ratio contact  associations external ideas  trade  latent capitalism boom  along with internal independent logic and inter-connectivity s impact now were observed roy a rappaport and hawkes hill and o connell s use of pyke s optimal foraging theory for the latter s work are some examples of this new focus
this perspective was based on general equilibriums and criticized for not addressing the variety of responses an organisms can have such as  loyalty solidarity friendliness and sanctity  and possible  incentives or inhibitors  in relations to behavior rappaport often referred to as a reductionist in his cultural studies methods acknowledges  the social unit is not always well defined  exhibiting another flaw in this perspective obfuscation of aspects of analyze and designated terms
policy and activism  politics versus environmentalism
the contemporary perspective of environmental anthropology and arguably at least the backdrop if not the focus of most of the ethnographies and cultural fieldworks of today is political ecology many characterize this new perspective as more informed with culture politics and power globalization localized issues and more the focus and data interpretation is often used for arguments for against or creation of policy and to prevent corporate exploitation and damage of land often the observer has become an active part of the struggle either directly  organizing participation  or indirectly  articles documentaries books ethnographies  such is the case with environmental justice advocate melissa checker and her relationship with the people of hyde park
critiques on this modern perspective and non-governmental organizations   ngos  influences and effects on social groups is usually that they  generalize  and  obscure  local discourse and message often resulting in environmentalism by bureaucrats pr firms governments and industry an example of negative effects can be ascertained in the malaysian rainforest in which ngos and other outsider activist deflected the issue ignoring the locality of the problem
history
origins and pioneers
environmental anthropology enters the field as an applied dimension built on the primary approaches within contemporary ecological anthropology it focuses on how culture promotes connections between humans and their occupied ecosystems american anthropologist julian steward  1902 1972  is the anthropological originator of cultural ecology a troubled childhood led to steward s fascination of the natural world in 1918 steward attended a california college found inspiration from the natural environment and gained insight which promoted a future passion toward ecological studies steward contributions to theories of cultural ecology and cultural evolution are renowned
transformations
steward officially formulated the basic theoretical and methodological framework for cultural ecology in the 1950s 60s the transformation of cultural ecology into ecological anthropology took place in the 1960s through the 1980s by anthropologists john bennett roy a rappaport andrew p vayda and others two additional theoretical and methodological frameworks surfaced in the 1980s and 90s which attempted to cast ecological anthropology in a more scientific light the first of which was when marvin harris actively and systematically worked to develop  cultural materialism  as an approach to research harris s intention was to expose and analyze the ecological logic underlying multiple facets of culture the cultural system was split into three parts by harris  infrastructure structure and superstructure eric alden smith and bruce winterhalder laid the blueprints for the second groundbreaking structure of evolutionary ecology this would shift attention to the individual as the origin of adaptation stressing choice when utilizing natural resources a further expansion of ecological anthropology occurred in the 1990s when historical political and spiritual focused areas of research were incorporated into facets of human ecology and adaptation
purpose
anthropology is a field concerned specifically with the human condition and its relation to the natural world  ie the capacity of a human to manipulate the world around them  this can be seen through human interactions between each other as well as the flora and fauna present in a person s particular region and how they can be utilized humans everywhere have changed their environment and for better or for worse taking a step back to the previous state of things would be a long arduous process so how can people erase the mistakes of the past  how can they bring old outdated things new life through innovation  these questions can provide insight into the development of a subfield of anthropology called environmental anthropology
environmental anthropology is a subfield of anthropology with roots in activism the main focus of this particular perspective focuses on a discourse of activism agents operating within this sphere of thought have noticed aversive effects from human related manipulation and are driven to try and force changes in the system which can eventually lead to replenishment of the region in question the discipline itself if ever-changing because it must evolve to satiate the needs and appropriately address issues from the state and region level all the way down to complex communities hence must uses a multitude of different approaches when considering a problem according to the society for applied anthropology  sfaa 
this means that a problem up stream of two separate cultural groups that affects them both can be resolved through a discourse of environmental anthropology and although the two groups may not speak the same language they can both activate to prompt change necessity can potentially quell conflict between two cultural groups if they must work together to combat an even bigger enemy  environmental injustice  applied anthropology utilizes these understandings to work with people on a local basis as well as trying to satisfy share holders working to gain a resolution for problems related to health education social welfare development and environmental protection
environmental anthropologists use a multitude of tools and orientations to best address the variance in different problems according to sfaa
environmental anthropologists aim to utilize their understanding of the culture at hand in order to gain as emic  an insider s understanding of the culture in question  a perspective as possible when dealing with these situations these type of situations are ideal within the field and sheds positive light on a field that is criticized for refusing to accept this perspective
