sustainability science - wikipedia
sustainability science has emerged in the 21st century as a new academic discipline this new field of science was officially introduced with a  birth statement  at the world congress  challenges of a changing earth 2001  in amsterdam organized by the international council for science  icsu  the international geosphere-biosphere programme  igbp  the international human dimensions programme on global environmental change and the world climate research programme  wcrp 
the field reflects a desire to give the generalities and broad-based approach of  sustainability  a stronger analytic and scientific underpinning as it 
the field is focused on examining the interactions between human environmental and engineered systems to understand and contribute to solutions for complex challenges that threaten the future of humanity and the integrity of the life support systems of the planet such as climate change biodiversity loss pollution and land and water degradation
sustainability science like sustainability itself derives some impetus from the concepts of sustainable development and environmental science sustainability science provides a critical framework for sustainability while sustainability measurement provides the evidence-based quantitative data needed to guide sustainability governance


definition
consensual definition of sustainability science is as elusive as the definition of  sustainability  or  sustainable development  as outlined by the sustainability science program at harvard university s center for international development sustainability science seeks to 
a more broad-based definition is 
it has been noted that the new paradigm
others take a much broader view of sustainability science emphasizing the need to analyze the root causes of the fundamental unsustainability of the prevailing economic system such as the emphasis on growth as key to solving political and social problems and advancying society s well-being in a 2012 article entitled  sustainability science needs to include sustainable consumption  published in environment  science and policy for sustainable development halina brown argues that sustainability science must include the study of the sociology of material consumption and the structure of consumerist society the role of technology in aggravating the unsustainable social practices as well as in solving the problems they create the macroeconomic theories that presuppose economic growth as a necessary condition for advancing societal well-being and others
broad objectives
the case for making research and development an important component of sustainable development strategies was embraced by many international scientific organizations in the mid-1980s promoted by the brundtland commission s report our common future in 1987 and noted in the agenda 21 plan that emerged from the united nations conference on environment and development in 1992 and further developed at the world summit on sustainable development held in johannesburg in 2002
the topics of the following sub-headings indicate recurring themes that are addressed in the literature of sustainability science only in 2010 have the seminal papers and thinking of sustainability scientists been drawn together in 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by robert kates with introduction by william clark as   readings in sustainability science and technology - an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science the 2012 commentary by halina brown extensively expands the scope of that seminal publication this is work in progress the 2012 encyclopedia of sustainability science and technology was created as a collaboration of over 1000 scientists to provide peer-reviewed entries covering sustainability research and policy evaluations of technology
knowledge structuring of issues
knowledge structuring has been identified as an essential first step in the effort to acquire a comprehensive view of sustainability issues which are both complex and interconnected this is needed as a response to the requirements of academia industry and government
coordination of data
the key research and data for sustainability are sourced from many scientific disciplines topics and organisations a major part of knowledge structuring will entail building up the tools that provide an  overview  of what is known sustainability science can construct and coordinate a framework within which the vast amount of data can be easily accessed
interdisciplinary approaches
the attempt by sustainability science to understand the integrated  whole  of planetary and human systems requires cooperation between scientific social and economic disciplines public and private sectors academia and government in short it requires a massive global cooperative effort and one major task of sustainability science is to assist integrated cross-disciplinary coordination
journals
list of sustainability science programs
in recent years there have been set up more and more study courses that are directly addressing the issues of sustainability science and global change 
in 2010 a compendium of basic papers in this new discipline was published by robert kates as readings in sustainability science and technology - an introduction to the key literature of sustainability science
recently numbers of people doing a phd gather under the title of sustainable sciences purposes they come from different backgrounds and work around this topic this sort of work enables the topic to be interdisciplinary and improve the work of phds here is an example of such gathering   bhioss group  birmingham initiative on sustainable sciences
