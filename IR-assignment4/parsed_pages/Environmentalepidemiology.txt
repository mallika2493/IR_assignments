environmental epidemiology - wikipedia
environmental epidemiology is the branches of epidemiology concerned with the discovery of the environmental exposures that contribute to or protect against injuries illnesses developmental conditions disabilities and deaths  and identification of public health and health care actions to manage the risks associated with harmful exposures environmental epidemiology studies external factors that affect the incidence prevalence and geographic range of health conditions these factors may be naturally occurring or may be introduced into environments where people live work and play environmental exposures are involuntary and thus generally exclude occupational exposures and voluntary exposures such as active smoking medications and diet
environmental exposures can be broadly categorized into those that are proximate  eg directly leading to a health condition  including chemicals physical agents and microbiological pathogens and those that are more distal such as social conditions climate change and other broad-scale environmental changes proximate exposures occur through air food water and skin contact distal exposures cause adverse health conditions directly by altering proximate exposures and indirectly through changes in ecosystems and other support systems for human health
environmental epidemiology research can inform risk assessments  development of standards and other risk management activities  and estimates of the co-benefits and co-harms of policies designed to reduce global environment change including policies implemented in other sectors  eg food and water  that can affect human health
vulnerability is the summation of all risk and protective factors that ultimately determine whether an individual or subpopulation experiences adverse health outcomes when an exposure to an environmental agent occurs sensitivity is an individual s or subpopulation s increased responsiveness primarily for biological reasons to that exposure biological sensitivity may be related to developmental stage pre-existing medical conditions acquired factors and genetic factors socioeconomic factors also play a critical role in altering vulnerability and sensitivity to environmentally mediated factors by increasing the likelihood of exposure to harmful agents interacting with biological factors that mediate risk and or leading to differences in the ability to prepare for or cope with exposures or early phases of illness populations living in certain regions may be at increased risk due to location and the environmental characteristics of a region specifically populations that live in toxic areas that are heavily polluted are at risk of developing pollution-related diseases such as heart disesae
