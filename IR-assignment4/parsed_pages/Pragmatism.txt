pragmatism - wikipedia
pragmatism as a philosophical tradition began in the united states around 1870 charles sanders peirce generally considered to be its founder later described it in his pragmatic maxim 
pragmatism rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe represent or mirror reality instead pragmatists consider thought an instrument or tool for prediction problem solving and action pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics such as the nature of knowledge language concepts meaning belief and science are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes the philosophy of pragmatism  emphasizes the practical application of ideas by acting on them to actually test them in human experiences  pragmatism focuses on a  changing universe rather than an unchanging one as the idealists realists and thomists had claimed 


origins
pragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the united states in the 1870s charles sanders peirce  and his pragmatic maxim  is given credit for its development along with later twentieth century contributors william james and john dewey its direction was determined by the metaphysical club members charles sanders peirce william james and chauncey wright as well as john dewey and george herbert mead
the first use in print of the name pragmatism was in 1898 by james who credited peirce with coining the term during the early 1870s james regarded peirce s 1877 8  illustrations of the logic of science  series  including  the fixation of belief  1877 and especially  how to make our ideas clear  1878  as the foundation of pragmatism  peirce in turn wrote in 1906 that nicholas st john green had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying alexander bain s definition of belief which was  that upon which a man is prepared to act  peirce wrote that  from this definition pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary  so that i am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism  john shook has said  chauncey wright also deserves considerable credit for as both peirce and james recall it was wright who demanded a phenomenalist and fallibilist empiricism as an alternative to rationalistic speculation 
peirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt not mere verbal or hyperbolic doubt and said in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way  consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception then your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object  which he later called the pragmatic maxim it equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object s effects this is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances   a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification typical of peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism although he was a mathematical logician and a founder of statistics
peirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation while framing a conception s meaning in terms of conceivable tests peirce emphasized that since a conception is general its meaning its intellectual purport equates to its acceptance s implications for general practice rather than to any definite set of real consequences  or test results   a conception s clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications but the outcomes are not meanings but individual upshots peirce in 1905 coined the new name pragmaticism  for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition  saying that  all went happily  with james s and schiller s variant uses of the old name  pragmatism  and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name s growing use in  literary journals where it gets abused  yet in a 1906 manuscript he cited as causes his differences with james and schiller and in a 1908 publication his differences with james as well as literary author giovanni papini peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real as being opposed by the other pragmatists but he remained allied with them on other issues
pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after willard van orman quine and wilfrid sellars used a revised pragmatism to criticize logical positivism in the 1960s inspired by the work of quine and sellars a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as neopragmatism gained influence through richard rorty the most influential of the late twentieth century pragmatists along with hilary putnam and robert brandom contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict analytic tradition and a  neo-classical  pragmatism  such as susan haack  that adheres to the work of peirce james and dewey
inspiration for various pragmatists included 
core tenets
a few of the various but interrelated positions often characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include 
anti-reification of concepts and theories
dewey in the quest for certainty criticized what he called  the philosophical fallacy  - philosophers often take categories  such as the mental and the physical  for granted because they don t realize that these are merely nominal concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems this causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion various examples are the  ultimate being  of hegelian philosophers the belief in a  realm of value  the idea that logic because it is an abstraction from concrete thought has nothing to do with the act of concrete thinking and so on david l hildebrand sums up the problem   perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience   hildebrand 2003 
naturalism and anti-cartesianism
from the outset pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with the scientific method as they understood it they argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp they held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by kant or to correspondence theories of knowledge and truth pragmatists criticized the former for its a priorism and the latter because it takes correspondence as an unanalyzable fact pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between knower and known
in 1868 cs peirce argued that there is no power of intuition in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference and no power of introspection intuitive or otherwise and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since descartes he argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process  such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages that which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around  de waal 2005 pp 7 10  at the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science  what we do think is too different from what we should think  in his  illustrations of the logic of science  series peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general this is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism
richard rorty expanded on these and other arguments in philosophy and the mirror of nature in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to and sometimes thought of as superior to the empirical sciences wv quine instrumental in bringing naturalized epistemology back into favor with his essay epistemology naturalized  quine 1969  also criticized  traditional  epistemology and its  cartesian dream  of absolute certainty the dream he argued was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry
reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism
hilary putnam has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism is the central goal of american pragmatism although all human knowledge is partial with no ability to take a  god s-eye-view  this does not necessitate a globalized skeptical attitude a radical philosophical skepticism  as distinguished from that which is called scientific skepticism  peirce insisted that  1  in reasoning there is the presupposition and at least the hope that truth and the real are discoverable and would be discovered sooner or later but still inevitably by investigation taken far enough and  2  contrary to descartes  famous and influential methodology in the meditations on first philosophy doubt cannot be feigned or created by verbal fiat to motivate fruitful inquiry and much less can philosophy begin in universal doubt doubt like belief requires justification genuine doubt irritates and inhibits in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act it arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact  which dewey called a  situation   which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of descartes the pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition
pragmatist theory of truth and epistemology
pragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge  schopenhauer advocated a biological idealism as what s useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an  ecological  account of knowledge  inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment real and true are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context it is not realist in a traditionally robust sense of realism  what hilary putnam would later call metaphysical realism  but it is realist in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with
many of james  best-turned phrases truth s cash value  james 1907 p 200  and the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking  james 1907 p 222  were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true william james wrote 
in reality james asserts the theory is a great deal more subtle  see dewey 1910 for a  faq  
the role of belief in representing reality is widely debated in pragmatism is a belief valid when it represents reality  copying is one  and only one  genuine mode of knowing  james 1907 p 91  are beliefs dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action  is it only in the struggle of intelligent organisms with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning  does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle  in pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be necessarily true nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term for example to believe my cheating spouse is faithful may help me feel better now but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn t accord with the facts  and is therefore not true 
pragmatism in other fields of philosophy
while pragmatism started out simply as a criterion of meaning it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration but their work is diverse and there are no received views
philosophy of science
in the philosophy of science instrumentalism is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena instrumentalism does not state that truth doesn t matter but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science
one of ci lewis  main arguments in mind and the world order  outline of a theory of knowledge was that science does not merely provide a copy of reality but must work with conceptual systems and that those are chosen for pragmatic reasons that is because they aid inquiry lewis  own development of multiple modal logics is a case in point lewis is sometimes called a  conceptual pragmatist  because of this  lewis 1929 
another development is the cooperation of logical positivism and pragmatism in the works of charles w morris and rudolf carnap the influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the pragmatic maxim into their epistemology pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement don t often refer to them
w v quine s paper  two dogmas of empiricism  published 1951 is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth-century philosophy in the analytic tradition the paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists  philosophy one is the distinction between analytic statements  tautologies and contradictions  whose truth  or falsehood  is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement   all bachelors are unmarried   and synthetic statements whose truth  or falsehood  is a function of  contingent  states of affairs the other is reductionism the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience quine s argument brings to mind peirce s insistence that axioms aren t a priori truths but synthetic statements
logic
later in his life schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook formal logic by then schiller s pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an ordinary language philosophy schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic by showing that words only had meaning when used in context the least famous of schiller s main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book formal logic in this sequel logic for use schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in formal logic what he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method
whereas fcs schiller dismissed the possibility of formal logic most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others or perhaps considering the multitude of formal logics one set of tools among others this is the view of ci lewis cs peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic
stephen toulmin s the uses of argument inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies  although it is an epistemological work 
metaphysics
james and dewey were empirical thinkers in the most straightforward fashion  experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained they were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because in the tradition dating from hume empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations to the pragmatists this went against the spirit of empiricism  we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality radical empiricism or immediate empiricism in dewey s words wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms
william james gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming 
fcs schiller s first book riddles of the sphinx was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in america in it schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics these opposites are comparable to what william james called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the  higher  aspects of our world these include freewill consciousness purpose universals and some would add god on the other hand abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the  lower  aspects of our world  eg the imperfect change physicality  while schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation
in the second half of the twentieth century stephen toulmin argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what  ultimate reality  consists of more recently a similar idea has been suggested by the postanalytical philosopher daniel dennett who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the  syntactical  aspects of reality  ie whizzing atoms  and its emergent or  semantic  properties  ie meaning and value 
radical empiricism gives interesting answers to questions about the limits of science if there are any the nature of meaning and value and the workability of reductionism these questions feature prominently in current debates about the relationship between religion and science where it is often assumed most pragmatists would disagree that science degrades everything that is meaningful into  merely  physical phenomena
philosophy of mind
both john dewey in experience and nature  1929  and half a century later richard rorty in his monumental philosophy and the mirror of nature  1979  argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions they argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an ontological category
pragmatists disagree over whether philosophers ought to adopt a quietist or a naturalist stance toward the mind-body problem the former  rorty among them  want to do away with the problem because they believe it s a pseudo-problem whereas the latter believe that it is a meaningful empirical question
ethics
pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason nor any ontological difference between facts and values both facts and values have cognitive content  knowledge is what we should believe  values are hypotheses about what is good in action pragmatist ethics is broadly humanist because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans good values are those for which we have good reasons viz the good reasons approach the pragmatist formulation pre-dates those of other philosophers who have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as jerome schneewind and john searle
william james  contribution to ethics as laid out in his essay the will to believe has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationality on its own terms it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait for adequate proof when making moral decisions
of the classical pragmatists john dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy  edel 1993  in his classic article three independent factors in morals  dewey 1930  he tried to integrate three basic philosophical perspectives on morality  the right the virtuous and the good he held that while all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions the possibility of conflict among the three elements cannot always be easily solved  anderson sep 
dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education both conceived as merely a means to an end he stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education that viewed it not as a preparation for life but as life itself  dewey 2004  ch 7  dewey 1997  p 47 
dewey was opposed to other ethical philosophies of his time notably the emotivism of alfred ayer dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline and thought values could best be characterized not as feelings or imperatives but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed consummatory experience a further implication of this view is that ethics is a fallible undertaking since human beings are frequently unable to know what would satisfy them
during the late 1900s and first decade of 2000 pragmatism was embraced by many in the field of bioethics led by the philosophers john lachs and his student glenn mcgee whose 1997 book   the perfect baby  a pragmatic approach to genetic engineering    see designer baby  garnered praise from within classical american philosophy and criticism from bioethics for its development of a theory of pragmatic bioethics and its rejection of the principalism theory then in vogue in medical ethics an anthology published by the mit press   pragmatic bioethics   included the responses of philosophers to that debate including micah hester griffin trotter and others many of whom developed their own theories based on the work of dewey peirce royce and others lachs himself developed several applications of pragmatism to bioethics independent of but extending from the work of dewey and james
a recent pragmatist contribution to meta-ethics is todd lekan s  making morality   lekan 2003  lekan argues that morality is a fallible but rational practice and that it has traditionally been misconceived as based on theory or principles instead he argues theory and rules arise as tools to make practice more intelligent
aesthetics
john dewey s art as experience based on the william james lectures he delivered at harvard was an attempt to show the integrity of art culture and everyday experience  field iep  art for dewey is or should be a part of everyone s creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists he also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient dewey s treatment of art was a move away from the transcendental approach to aesthetics in the wake of immanuel kant who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation
a notable contemporary pragmatist aesthetician is joseph margolis he defines a work of art as  a physically embodied culturally emergent entity  a human  utterance  that isn t an ontological quirk but in line with other human activity and culture in general he emphasizes that works of art are complex and difficult to fathom and that no determinate interpretation can be given
philosophy of religion
both dewey and james investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society the former in a common faith and the latter in the varieties of religious experience
it should be noted from a general point of view that for william james something is true only insofar as it works thus the statement for example that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but  a  may not help to bring about the things you pray for  b  may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are heard as such pragmatism isn t antithetical to religion but it isn t an apologetic for faith either james  metaphysical position however leaves open the possibility that the ontological claims of religions may be true as he observed in the end of the varieties his position does not amount to a denial of the existence of transcendent realities quite the contrary he argued for the legitimate epistemic right to believe in such realities since such beliefs do make a difference in an individual s life and refer to claims that cannot be verified or falsified either on intellecutal or common sensorial grounds
joseph margolis in historied thought constructed world  california 1995  makes a distinction between  existence  and  reality  he suggests using the term  exists  only for those things which adequately exhibit peirce s secondness  things which offer brute physical resistance to our movements in this way such things which affect us like numbers may be said to be  real  although they do not  exist  margolis suggests that god in such a linguistic usage might very well be  real  causing believers to act in such and such a way but might not  exist 
analytical neoclassical and neopragmatism
neopragmatism is a broad contemporary category used for various thinkers some of them radically opposed to one another the name neopragmatist signifies that the thinkers in question incorporate important insights of and yet significantly diverge from the classical pragmatists this divergence may occur either in their philosophical methodology  many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition  or in conceptual formation  ci lewis was very critical of dewey  richard rorty dislikes peirce  important analytical neopragmatists include the aforementioned lewis w v o quine donald davidson hilary putnam and the early richard rorty brazilian social thinker roberto unger advocates for a  radical pragmatism  one that  de-naturalizes  society and culture and thus insists that we can  transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change little by little the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them  stanley fish the later rorty and j rgen habermas are closer to continental thought
neoclassical pragmatism denotes those thinkers who consider themselves inheritors of the project of the classical pragmatists sidney hook and susan haack  known for the theory of foundherentism  are well-known examples many pragmatist ideas  especially those of peirce  find a natural expression in the decision-theoretic reconstruction of epistemology pursued in the work of isaac levi nicholas rescher advocates his version of  methodical pragmatism  based on construing pragmatic efficacy not as a replacement for truths but as a means to its evidentiation
not all pragmatists are easily characterized it is probable considering the advent of postanalytic philosophy and the diversification of anglo-american philosophy that more philosophers will be influenced by pragmatist thought without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school daniel dennett a student of quine s falls into this category as does stephen toulmin who arrived at his philosophical position via wittgenstein whom he calls  a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind   foreword for dewey 1929 in the 1988 edition p xiii  another example is mark johnson whose embodied philosophy  lakoff and johnson 1999  shares its psychologism direct realism and anti-cartesianism with pragmatism conceptual pragmatism is a theory of knowledge originating with the work of the philosopher and logician clarence irving lewis the epistemology of conceptual pragmatism was first formulated in the 1929 book mind and the world order  outline of a theory of knowledge
 french pragmatism  is attended with theorists such as bruno latour michel crozier luc boltanski and laurent th venot it is often seen as opposed to structural problems connected to the french critical theory of pierre bourdieu
legacy and contemporary relevance
in the twentieth century the movements of logical positivism and ordinary language philosophy have similarities with pragmatism like pragmatism logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics however logical positivism doesn t stress action as pragmatism does furthermore the pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense usually pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection
ordinary language philosophy is closer to pragmatism than other philosophy of language because of its nominalist character and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between language and world
pragmatism has ties to process philosophy much of their work developed in dialogue with process philosophers such as henri bergson and alfred north whitehead who aren t usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points  douglas browning et al 1998  rescher sep 
behaviorism and functionalism in psychology and sociology also have ties to pragmatism which is not surprising considering that james and dewey were both scholars of psychology and that mead became a sociologist
utilitarianism has some significant parallels to pragmatism and john stuart mill espoused similar values
pragmatism emphasizes the connection between thought and action applied fields like public administration political science leadership studies international relations conflict resolution and research methodology have incorporated the tenets of pragmatism in their field often this connection is made using dewey and addams s expansive notion of democracy
influence of pragmatism in social sciences
symbolic interactionism a major perspective within sociological social psychology was derived from pragmatism in the early twentieth century especially the work of george herbert mead and charles cooley as well as that of peirce and william james
increasing attention is being given to pragmatist epistemology in other branches of the social sciences which have struggled with divisive debates over the status of social scientific knowledge
enthusiasts suggest that pragmatism offers an approach which is both pluralist and practical
influence of pragmatism in public administration
the classical pragmatism of john dewey william james and charles sanders peirce has influenced research in the field of public administration scholars claim classical pragmatism had a profound influence on the origin of the field of public administration at the most basic level public administrators are responsible for making programs  work  in a pluralistic problems-oriented environment public administrators are also responsible for the day-to-day work with citizens dewey s participatory democracy can be applied in this environment dewey and james  notion of theory as a tool helps administrators craft theories to resolve policy and administrative problems further the birth of american public administration coincides closely with the period of greatest influence of the classical pragmatists
which pragmatism  classical pragmatism or neo-pragmatism  makes the most sense in public administration has been the source of debate the debate began when patricia m shields introduced dewey s notion of the community of inquiry hugh miller objected to one element of the community of inquiry  problematic situation scientific attitude participatory democracy    scientific attitude a debate that included responses from a practitioner an economist a planner other public administration scholars and noted philosophers followed miller and shields also responded
in addition applied scholarship of public administration that assesses charter schools contracting out or outsourcing financial management performance measurement urban quality of life initiatives and urban planning in part draws on the ideas of classical pragmatism in the development of the conceptual framework and focus of analysis
the health sector s administrators  use of pragmatism has been criticized as incomplete in its pragmatism however according to the classical pragmatists knowledge is always shaped by human interests the administrator s focus on  outcomes  simply advances their own interest and this focus on outcomes often undermines their citizen s interests which often are more concerned with process on the other hand david brendel argues that pragmatism s ability to bridge dualisms focus on practical problems include multiple perspectives incorporate participation from interested parties  patient family health team  and provisional nature makes it well suited to address problems in this area
pragmatism and feminism
since the mid 1990s feminist philosophers have re-discovered classical pragmatism as a source of feminist theories works by seigfried duran keith and whipps explore the historic and philosophic links between feminism and pragmatism the connection between pragmatism and feminism took so long to be rediscovered because pragmatism itself was eclipsed by logical positivism during the middle decades of the twentieth century as a result it was lost from femininist discourse the very features of pragmatism that led to its decline are the characteristics that feminists now consider its greatest strength these are  persistent and early criticisms of positivist interpretations of scientific methodology  disclosure of value dimension of factual claims   viewing aesthetics as informing everyday experience  subordinating logical analysis to political cultural and social issues  linking the dominant discourses with domination   realigning theory with praxis  and resisting the turn to epistemology and instead emphasizing concrete experience  these feminist philosophers point to jane addams as a founder of classical pragmatism in addition the ideas of dewey mead and james are consistent with many feminist tenets jane addams john dewey and george herbert mead developed their philosophies as all three became friends influenced each other and were engaged in the hull-house experience and women s rights causes
pragmatism and urbanism
one application of pragmatism that is being developed is the one between pragmatism and urbanism  urban transformation a pragmatic approach to urban transformation values and evaluates the consequences of a design rather than only considering the initial intentions according to the pragmatic maxim an object or conception can only be fully understood through its practical consequences in an urban context this signifies how the implementation  and its effects  of a concept or design alters the overall understanding of the concept richard rorty mentions that  a sea change  is occurring in recent philosophical thought    a change so profound that we may not recognize that it is occurring  while the world that the movement is rooted in has had many changes as a frame to perceive the world pragmatism also has experienced different levels of modifications those changes are very relevant to the development of cities and basic themes such as anti-foundationalism fallibilism community as inquirers questioning the sharp distinction between theory and practice pluralism and democracy of pragmatism may be applied to the urbanism even more strongly
vincent di norcia argues that a pragmatic approach is suitable regarding social issues because it requires a conduct that resolves problems as it continuously assesses the practical consequences of a project this secures the interest for the stakeholders and norcia stresses the importance of social and cognitive pluralism social pluralism means that we should recognize all stake holder s interest that are affected by a certain decision without putting weight on elite political or economic group s interests as a complement norcia also stresses cognitive pluralism which indicates that one should include all kinds of knowledge that are relevant to a problem
criticisms
arthur oncken lovejoy criticized pragmatism in his 1908 essay  the thirteen pragmatisms  where he identifies thirteen different philosophical positions that were each labeled pragmatism lovejoy argues that there is significant ambiguity in the notion of the consequences of the truth of a proposition and those of belief in a proposition in order to highlight that many pragmatists had failed to recognize that distinction
neopragmatism as represented by richard rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by neoclassical pragmatists such as susan haack  haack 1997  and by many analytic philosophers  dennett 1998  rorty s early analytical work however differs notably from his later work which some including rorty consider to be closer to literary criticism than to philosophy and which attracts the brunt of criticism from his detractors
