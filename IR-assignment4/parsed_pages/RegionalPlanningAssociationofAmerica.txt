founders
clarence stein
clarence stein attended the ethical culture society s workingman s school which influenced his interest in the city life and social responsibility through its teaching stein was closely influenced by the founder of ethical culture felix adler and teacher john lovejoy elliott in involvement with movements and committees such as the hudson guild settlement house and the progressive reform movement in new york city at the turn-of-the-century therefore stein s enrollment at workingman s school proved to be of strong influence on his later interests and achievements the very principle of the ethical culture society being  that an individual s growth toward excellence comes from furthering the unlike excellence of others  exemplifies the basis of stein s life achievements through the rpaa
stein first met future fellow rpaa members henry wright and alexander bing in washington  in 1918  through a friend charles whitaker  editor of the jaia  in 1920 stein became the associate editor for community planning with the journal of the american institute of architects and soon later discovered the idea to create the rpaa including his friends at the jaia office including lewis mumford as well as many others the group included members in various fields of study from architects to union leaders city officials to writers and engineers to sociologists and so on april 18 1923 the first official meeting of the regional planning association of america was held the association began with only a total of eight people present at its first official meeting but it soon grew
benton mackaye
the first major project of the rpaa was that of fellow rpaa member benton mackaye  the appalachian trail a trail which we would refer to today as a greenway of which he wrote an article in the jaia two years earlier   an appalachian trail   a project in regional planning   the trail was planned to connect a foot path from maine to georgia in an attempt to  lead civilization to the wilderness  the project was not directly implemented by the rpaa however their part was successful in introducing their idea to others and helping the various groups of mountain clubs come together to create the final project the majority of the trail was completed by the mid-1930s from this project came another main goal of the rpaa which was to create  the preservation of large areas of the natural environment including parts of the wilderness as a green matrix for shaping a  regional city  and for serving its various-sized spatially well defined specialized communities 
lewis mumford
the success in publicizing this project as well as others was in large part due to lewis mumford mumford was the rpaa s leading journalist and spokesperson having published his first book in 1922 the story of utopia and well on his way with another mumford was extremely useful to the association he worked on not only books and articles related to the rpaa but also wrote edited policy documents mumford also contributed to the group by sharing his interest of patrick geddes  ideas on regional development and planning mumford contributed concepts of  a dispersed yet concentrated urban culture integrated with nature  which were integrated along with mackaye s concepts into the rpaa s later projects
sunnyside and radburn
the leading community building experiments conceptualized and implemented by the rpaa were sunnyside gardens queens and radburn new jersey sunnyside started as a small-scale housing development experiment in queens new york the goal was  to produce good homes at as low a price as possible to make the company s investment safe and to use the work of building and selling houses as a laboratory to work out better house and block plans and better methods of building  radburn new jersey would be the new and improved built community utilizing the analysis from the sunnyside community experiment
alexander bing
these communities would not have been able to be implemented if it were not for fellow rpaa member alexander bing bing was the group s financial backing through not only his own real estate company and wealth but through his outstanding real estate and business skills bing president of the rpaa found the funds through outside contributions and personal contribution  more so than any other member  to support the projects of the association for the sunnyside community project bing founded the city housing corporation through which he would establish the funding and opportunity to complete the project
henry wright
henry wright known as the analyst due to his never-ending questioning and analysis on projects worked alongside stein in site designs and development on such projects as sunnyside new york studied architecture at the university of pennsylvania along with work as a landscape architect and site planner wright shared many interests with stein close work in 1923 on the sunnyside homes development with stein led to a trip to england in 1924 to study the designs of unwin and parker as well as that of ebeneezer howard though close at the beginning of the association s organization wright went on to establish  the housing study guild  along with several rpaa members which stein viewed to work more independently than directly with the rpaa s projects this slight dispute would be the beginning point of the division and end of the regional planning association of america in 1933 many members began to move away and or join various other movements or committees which quickly led to the association s end
