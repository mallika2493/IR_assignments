transit-oriented development - wikipedia
a transit-oriented development  tod  is a mixed-use residential and commercial area designed to maximize access to public transport and often incorporates features to encourage transit ridership while dissuading the ownership of automobiles a tod neighborhood typically has a center with a transit station or stop  train station metro station tram stop or bus stop  surrounded by relatively high-density development with progressively lower-density development spreading outward from the center tods generally are located within a radius of one-quarter to one-half mile  400 to 800 m  from a transit stop as this is considered to be an appropriate scale for pedestrians thus solving the last mile problem


description
many of the new towns created after world war ii in japan sweden and france have many of the characteristics of tod communities in a sense nearly all communities built on reclaimed land in the netherlands or as exurban developments in denmark have had the local equivalent of tod principles integrated in their planning including the promotion of bicycles for local use
in the united states a half-mile-radius circle has become the de facto standard for rail-transit catchment areas for tods a half mile  800 m  corresponds to the distance someone can walk in 10 minutes at 3 mph  4.8 km h  and is a common estimate for the distance people will walk to get to a rail station the half-mile ring is a little more than 500 acres  2.0 km2  in size
transit-oriented development is sometimes distinguished by some planning officials from  transit-proximate development   see eg comments made during a congressional hearing   because it contains specific features that are designed to encourage public transport use and differentiate the development from urban sprawl examples of these features include mixed-use development that will use transit at all times of day excellent pedestrian facilities such as high quality pedestrian crossings narrow streets and tapering of buildings as they become more distant from the public transport node another key feature of transit-oriented development that differentiates it from  transit-proximate development  is reduced amounts of parking for personal vehicles
opponents of compact or transit oriented development typically argue that americans and persons throughout the world prefer low-density living and that any policies that encourage compact development will result in substantial utility decreases and hence large social welfare costs proponents of compact development argue that there are large often unmeasured benefits of compact development or that the american preference for low-density living is a misinterpretation made possible in part by substantial local government interference in the land market
tod in cities

one of the earliest and most successful examples of tod is curitiba brazil curitiba was organized into transport corridors very early on in its history over the years it has integrated its zoning laws and transportation planning to place high-density development adjacent to high-capacity transportation systems particularly its brt corridors since the failure of its first rather grandiose city plan due to lack of funding curitiba has focused on working with economical forms of infrastructure so it has arranged unique adaptations such as bus routes  inexpensive infrastructure  with routing systems limited access and speeds similar to subway systems the source of innovation in curitiba has been a unique form of participatory city planning that emphasizes public education discussion and agreement

europe
the term transit-oriented development as a us-born concept is rarely used in europe although many of the measures advocated in transit-oriented development are also stressed here many european cities have long been built around transit systems and there has thus often been little or no need to differentiate this type of development with a special term as has been the case in the us an example of this is copenhagen s finger plan from 1947 which embodied many transit-oriented development aspects and is still used as an overall planning framework today recently scholars and technicians have taken interest in the concept however

equity and housing cost concerns
one criticism of transit-oriented development is that it has the potential to spur gentrification in low-income areas in some cases tod can raise the housing costs of formerly affordable neighborhoods pushing low- and moderate-income residents farther away from jobs and transit when this happens tod projects can disrupt low-income neighborhoods
when executed with equity in mind however tod has the potential to benefit low- and moderate-income  lmi  communities  it can link workers to employment centers create construction and maintenance jobs and has the potential to encourage investment in areas that have suffered neglect and economic depression moreover it is well recognized that neighborhood development restrictions while potentially in the immediate neighborhood s best interest contribute to regional undersupply of housing and drive up the cost of housing in general across a region tod development reduces the overall cost of housing in a region by contributing to the housing supply and therefore generally improves equitability in the housing market tod also reduces transportation costs which can have a greater impact on lmi households since they spend a larger share of their income on transportation relative to higher-income households this frees up household income that can be used on food education or other necessary expenses low-income people are also less likely to own personal vehicles and therefore more likely to depend exclusively on public transportation to get to and from work making reliable access to transit a necessity for their economic success
