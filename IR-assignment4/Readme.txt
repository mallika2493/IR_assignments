ii) path of parsed file(corpus)
iii) press q to quit 
iv) enter the desired query and fetch the results(lucent scoring)
v) repeat steps from i to iv for all other queries


Task 2
Run command: python HW4.py 
This python file calculates the similarity scores and writes the scores in the decreasing order for the documents(for top 100). 

Below are the 8 files containing results in results folder for 4 queries for task1 and task2:
the order/format of the files
query_id Q0 doc_id rank CosineSim_score system_name
folder unigram contains below files
1. /results/cosine_similarity_1.csv contains the result for query id 1
2. /results/cosine_similarity_2.csv contains the result for query id 2
3. /results/cosine_similarity_3.csv contains the result for query id 3
4. /results/cosine_similarity_4.csv contains the result for query id 4
5. /results/task1_query1.csv contains the result for query id 1 for task1
6. /results/task1_query2.csv contains the result for query id 2 for task1
7. /results/task1_query3.csv contains the result for query id 3 for task1
