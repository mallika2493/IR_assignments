history
acec traces its roots to the founding of the american institute of consulting engineers  aice  in 1909 in its first years aice was largely a new york city-focused organization with more than half of its members working in the new york city area the organization was active in opposing the use of publicly employed engineers on public projects and advocated for engineers to be hired based on their qualifications rather than price
in 1956 representatives from 10 state associations representing consulting engineers met in tulsa okla and created the consulting engineers council a nationwide association to promote the business interests of engineers the new organization had an initial membership of 494 individuals and firms in 1959 cec joined the international federation of consulting engineers  fidic  by 1960 cec had 29 state-based member organizations represented more than 1,000 firms and had established a group liability insurance program
cec supported the passage of the a e selection procedures act also known as the brooks act in 1972 which requires that the us federal government select engineering and architecture firms based upon their competency qualifications and experience rather than by price the council has been a major proponent of the act s qualifications-based selection  qbs  rules ever since repeatedly beating back efforts from federal agencies to use price in procuring engineering services
