early life
howard was born in fore street city of london the son of ebenezer howard  1818 1900  a baker and ann  n e tow born 1818  he was sent to schools in suffolk and hertfordshire howard left school at 15 and began working as a stenographer in london howard subsequently had several clerical jobs including one with dr parker of the city temple in 1871 at the age of 21 influenced partly by a farming uncle howard emigrated with two friends to america he went to nebraska and after his farming efforts failed discovered he did not wish to be a farmer he then relocated to chicago and worked as a reporter for the courts and newspapers in the us he became acquainted with and admired poets walt whitman and ralph waldo emerson howard began to ponder ways to improve the quality of life
later life
by 1876 he was back in england where he found a job with hansard company which produces the official verbatim record of parliament and he spent the rest of his life in this occupation howard s time in parliament exposed him to ideas about social reform and helped inspire his ideas for the garden city in august 1879 he married eliza ann bills howard has been described as a humble and practical inventor who used his spare time to create outlines of new cities it was the social milieu of the 1800s which led howard to consider the social problems of the time and try to find alternatives howard mingled with free thinkers anarchists and socialists whose revolutionary and reforming ideas greatly influenced him
following the death of his wife eliza ann bills  1853 1904  in 1907 he married edith annie hayward  1864 1941  who ended her days as edith lady howard and with whom he is buried in letchworth cemetery
influences and ideas
howard read widely including edward bellamy s 1888 utopian novel looking backward and henry george s economic treatise progress and poverty and thought much about social issues he disliked the way modern cities were being developed and thought people should live in places that should combine the best aspects of both cities and the countryside
publications
the only publication he wrote in his life was titled to-morrow  a peaceful path to real reform which was significantly revised in 1902 as garden cities of to-morrow garden cities of to-morrow was based on ideas of social and urban reform garden cities were to avoid the downfalls of industrial cities of the time such as urban poverty overcrowding low wages dirty alleys with no drainage poorly ventilated houses toxic substances dust carbon gases infectious disease and lack of interaction with nature this book offered a vision of towns free of slums and enjoying the benefits of both town  such as opportunity amusement and good wages  and country  such as beauty fresh air and low rents  he illustrated the idea with his famous three magnets diagram  pictured  which addressed the question  where will the people go   the choices being  town   country  or  town-country  garden cities of tomorrow proposed that society be reorganised with networks of garden cities that would break the strong hold of capitalism and lead to cooperative socialism
it proposed the creation of new suburban towns of limited size planned in advance and surrounded by a permanent belt of agricultural land these garden cities were used as the model for many suburbs howard believed that such garden cities were the perfect blend of city and naturehoward believed that a new civilisation could be found by marrying the town and the country the towns would be largely independent managed by the citizens who had an economic interest in them and financed by ground rents on the georgist model the land on which they were to be built was to be owned by a group of trustees and leased to the citizens
while many believe the diagrams and designs in howard s garden cities of tomorrow to be a physical plan for the perfect garden city howard notes these to be merely suggestive as each city should be planned to be organised as per the needs of the people and their environment howard never intended for garden cities to be circular like his diagrams
action
in 1899 he founded the garden cities association known now as the town and country planning association
by his association with henry harvey vivian and the co-partnership housing movement his ideas attracted enough attention and funding to begin letchworth garden city a suburban garden city 37 miles north of london a second garden city welwyn garden city was started after world war i
his acquaintance with german architects hermann muthesius and bruno taut resulted in the application of humane design principles in many large housing projects built in the weimar republic hermann muthesius also played an important role in the creation of germany s first garden city of hellerau in 1909 the only german garden city where howard s ideas were thoroughly adopted
the creation of letchworth garden city and welwyn garden city were influential for the development of  new towns  after world war ii by the british government this produced more than 30 communities the first being stevenage hertfordshire  about halfway between letchworth and welwyn  and the last  and largest  being milton keynes buckinghamshire howard s ideas also influenced other planners such as frederick law olmsted ii and clarence perry walt disney used elements of howard s concepts in his original design for epcot  experimental prototype community of tomorrow 
in 1913 howard founded the  garden cities and town planning association    presently the international federation for housing and planning its goal was to promote the concept of planned housing and to improve the general standard of the profession by the international exchange of knowledge and experience
howard was an enthusiastic speaker of esperanto often using the language for his speeches
howard is buried in a modest grave in letchworth cemetery with his second wife edith annie lady howard
letchworth garden city
letchworth was developed and owned by a company called first garden city ltd which was formed in 1903 based on the ideas of howard after howard s book was published he worked to gain financial support to bring his ideas into reality howard ran lectures on garden cities and began the garden city association the garden city association collected money from supporters his supporters tended to be people who were impressed by the social justice element of the garden city the letchworth estate which was agricultural land was purchased from 15 individual owners the letchworth estate lies on a train line and is only 35 miles from london making commuting possible
the original land on which letchworth was built cost the first garden city ltd  160,378 and covered 3826 acres however more land was purchased and the property increased to 4710 acres the letchworth garden city was to sustain a population of between 30,000 and 35,000 people and would be laid out as howard explained in his book there would be a central town agricultural belt shops factories residences civic centres and open spaces this division of land for specific purposes is now referred to as zoning and is an important practice within town planning
howard constructed letchworth as an example of how the garden city could be achieved and hoped that in its success many other towns would be built emulating the same ideals some criticisms of letchworth exist claims that it is too spacious and there are few architecturally impressive designs however it can be argued the space is what makes letchworth pleasant and the architecture while not highly impressive and uniform has consistency of colour and is satisfying to the needs of the people
welwyn garden city
welwyn was an area of woodlands and open fields before the garden city was constructed welwyn was howard s second garden city after letchworth howard purchased the land with  5000 borrowed from friends welwyn is only 20 miles from london and captured the charm of the countryside and managed to stay unspoiled by urbanisation the architecture in welwyn has been described as pleasant and the residential cottages with their wide roads and open spaces make welwyn a refreshing picture when compared to london of the time
after 10 years of existence welwyn had a population of 10,000 with well-established residential industrial and commercial zones in 1930 the health of welwyn inhabitants was considered greater than those living in london as welwyn recorded lower death rates and infant mortality rates the increased health in welwyn was understood to be due to the principles of the garden city
it could be argued that welwyn fell short of howard s ideals howard wanted investors to invest for the sake of philanthropy but investors wanted returns and local democracy failed with an exclusive government group formed finally welwyn was marketed as a middle class commuter suburb entirely disrespecting the garden city ideals of a self-reliant city
honours
howard was appointed an officer of the order of the british empire in 1924 and a knight bachelor in 1927
