history
the concepts behind placemaking originated in the 1960s when writers like jane jacobs and william h whyte offered groundbreaking ideas about designing cities that catered to people not just to cars and shopping centers their work focused on the importance of lively neighborhoods and inviting public spaces jacobs advocated citizen ownership of streets through the now-famous idea of  eyes on the street  whyte emphasized essential elements for creating social life in public spaces
the term came into use in the 1970s by landscape architects architects and urban planners to describe the process of creating squares plazas parks streets and waterfronts that will attract people because they are pleasurable or interesting landscape often plays an important role in the design process the term encourages disciplines involved in designing the built environment to work together in pursuit of qualities that they each alone are unable to achieve
bernard hunt of hta architects noted that   we have theories specialisms regulations exhortations demonstration projects we have planners we have highway engineers we have mixed use mixed tenure architecture community architecture urban design neighbourhood strategy but what seems to have happened is that we have simply lost the art of placemaking  or put another way we have lost the simple art of placemaking we are good at putting up buildings but we are bad at making places 
jan gehl has said  first life then spaces then buildings   the other way around never works   and  in a society becoming steadily more privatized with private homes cars computers offices and shopping centers the public component of our lives is disappearing it is more and more important to make the cities inviting so we can meet our fellow citizens face to face and experience directly through our senses public life in good quality public spaces is an important part of a democratic life and a full life 

the writings of poet wendell berry have contributed to an imaginative grasp of place and placemaking particularly with reference to local ecology and local economy he writes that  if what we see and experience if our country does not become real in imagination then it never can become real to us and we are forever divided from it imagination is a particularizing and a local force native to the ground underfoot 
both the opportunities available to individuals and the choices made based on those opportunities impact individual family and community health the world health organization s definition of health provides an appropriate broad-reaching understanding of health as a  resource for everyday life not the object of living  and an important frame for discussing the interconnections between place and health
