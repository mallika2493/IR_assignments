sociology - wikipedia
sociology is the study of social behaviour or society including its origins development organization networks and institutions it is a social science that uses various methods of empirical investigation and critical analysis to develop a body of knowledge about social order disorder and change many sociologists aim to conduct research that may be applied directly to social policy and welfare while others focus primarily on refining the theoretical understanding of social processes subject matter ranges from the micro-sociology level of individual agency and interaction to the macro level of systems and the social structure
the traditional focuses of sociology include social stratification social class social mobility religion secularization law sexuality and deviance as all spheres of human activity are affected by the interplay between social structure and individual agency sociology has gradually expanded its focus to further subjects such as health medical military and penal institutions the internet education social capital and the role of social activity in the development of scientific knowledge
the range of social scientific methods has also expanded social researchers draw upon a variety of qualitative and quantitative techniques the linguistic and cultural turns of the mid-twentieth century led to increasingly interpretative hermeneutic and philosophic approaches towards the analysis of society conversely the end of the 1990s and the beginning of 2000s have seen the rise of new analytically mathematically and computationally rigorous techniques such as agent-based modelling and social network analysis
social research informs politicians and policy makers educators planners legislators administrators developers business magnates managers social workers non-governmental organizations non-profit organizations and people interested in resolving social issues in general there is often a great deal of crossover between social research market research and other statistical fields


classification
sociology shouldn t be confused with various general social studies courses which bear little relation to sociological theory or social science research methodology the us national science foundation classifies sociology as a stem field
history
origins
sociological reasoning pre-dates the foundation of the discipline social analysis has origins in the common stock of western knowledge and philosophy and has been carried out from as far back as the time of ancient greek philosopher plato if not before the origin of the survey ie the collection of information from a sample of individuals can be traced back to at least the domesday book in 1086 while ancient philosophers such as confucius wrote on the importance of social roles there is evidence of early sociology in medieval islam some consider ibn khaldun a 14th-century arab islamic scholar from north africa  tunisia  to have been the first sociologist and father of sociology  see branches of the early islamic philosophy   his muqaddimah was perhaps the first work to advance social-scientific reasoning on social cohesion and social conflict
the word sociology  or  sociologie   is derived from both latin and greek origins the latin word  socius  companion   the suffix -logy  the study of  from greek -      from       l gos  word   knowledge  it was first coined in 1780 by the french essayist emmanuel-joseph siey s  1748 1836  in an unpublished manuscript sociology was later defined independently by the french philosopher of science auguste comte  1798 1857  in 1838 comte used this term to describe a new way of looking at society comte had earlier used the term  social physics  but that had subsequently been appropriated by others most notably the belgian statistician adolphe quetelet comte endeavoured to unify history psychology and economics through the scientific understanding of the social realm writing shortly after the malaise of the french revolution he proposed that social ills could be remedied through sociological positivism an epistemological approach outlined in the course in positive philosophy  1830 1842  and a general view of positivism  1848  comte believed a positivist stage would mark the final era after conjectural theological and metaphysical phases in the progression of human understanding in observing the circular dependence of theory and observation in science and having classified the sciences comte may be regarded as the first philosopher of science in the modern sense of the term
both auguste comte and karl marx  1818 1883  set out to develop scientifically justified systems in the wake of european industrialization and secularization informed by various key movements in the philosophies of history and science marx rejected comtean positivism but in attempting to develop a science of society nevertheless came to be recognized as a founder of sociology as the word gained wider meaning for isaiah berlin marx may be regarded as the  true father  of modern sociology  in so far as anyone can claim the title 
herbert spencer  27 april 1820   8 december 1903  was one of the most popular and influential 19th-century sociologists it is estimated that he sold one million books in his lifetime far more than any other sociologist at the time so strong was his influence that many other 19th century thinkers including  mile durkheim defined their ideas in relation to his durkheim s division of labour in society is to a large extent an extended debate with spencer from whose sociology many commentators now agree durkheim borrowed extensively also a notable biologist spencer coined the term  survival of the fittest  while marxian ideas defined one strand of sociology spencer was a critic of socialism as well as strong advocate for a laissez-faire style of government his ideas were highly observed by conservative political circles especially in the united states and england
foundations of the academic discipline
the first formal department of sociology in the world was established by albion small - at the invitation of william rainey harper - at the university of chicago in 1892 and the american journal of sociology was founded shortly thereafter in 1895 by small as well however the institutionalization of sociology as an academic discipline was chiefly led by  mile durkheim  1858 1917  who developed positivism as a foundation to practical social research while durkheim rejected much of the detail of comte s philosophy he retained and refined its method maintaining that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity and insisting that they may retain the same objectivity rationalism and approach to causality durkheim set up the first european department of sociology at the university of bordeaux in 1895 publishing his rules of the sociological method  1895  for durkheim sociology could be described as the  science of institutions their genesis and their functioning 
durkheim s monograph suicide  1897  is considered a seminal work in statistical analysis by contemporary sociologists suicide is a case study of variations in suicide rates among catholic and protestant populations and served to distinguish sociological analysis from psychology or philosophy it also marked a major contribution to the theoretical concept of structural functionalism by carefully examining suicide statistics in different police districts he attempted to demonstrate that catholic communities have a lower suicide rate than that of protestants something he attributed to social  as opposed to individual or psychological  causes he developed the notion of objective sui generis  social facts  to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study through such studies he posited that sociology would be able to determine whether any given society is  healthy  or  pathological  and seek social reform to negate organic breakdown or  social anomie 
sociology quickly evolved as an academic response to the perceived challenges of modernity such as industrialization urbanization secularization and the process of  rationalization  the field predominated in continental europe with british anthropology and statistics generally following on a separate trajectory by the turn of the 20th century however many theorists were active in the anglo-saxon world few early sociologists were confined strictly to the subject interacting also with economics jurisprudence psychology and philosophy with theories being appropriated in a variety of different fields since its inception sociological epistemology methods and frames of inquiry have significantly expanded and diverged
durkheim marx and the german theorist max weber  1864 1920  are typically cited as the three principal architects of sociology herbert spencer william graham sumner lester f ward w e b du bois vilfredo pareto alexis de tocqueville werner sombart thorstein veblen ferdinand t nnies georg simmel and karl mannheim are often included on academic curricula as founding theorists curricula also may include charlotte perkins gilman marianne weber and friedrich engels as founders of the feminist tradition in sociology each key figure is associated with a particular theoretical perspective and orientation
positivism and anti-positivism
the overarching methodological principle of positivism is to conduct sociology in broadly the same manner as natural science an emphasis on empiricism and the scientific method is sought to provide a tested foundation for sociological research based on the assumption that the only authentic knowledge is scientific knowledge and that such knowledge can only arrive by positive affirmation through scientific methodology
the term has long since ceased to carry this meaning  there are no fewer than twelve distinct epistemologies that are referred to as positivism many of these approaches do not self-identify as  positivist  some because they themselves arose in opposition to older forms of positivism and some because the label has over time become a term of abuse by being mistakenly linked with a theoretical empiricism the extent of antipositivist criticism has also diverged with many rejecting the scientific method and others only seeking to amend it to reflect 20th century developments in the philosophy of science however positivism  broadly understood as a scientific approach to the study of society  remains dominant in contemporary sociology especially in the united states
lo c wacquant distinguishes three major strains of positivism  durkheimian logical and instrumental none of these are the same as that set forth by comte who was unique in advocating such a rigid  and perhaps optimistic  version while  mile durkheim rejected much of the detail of comte s philosophy he retained and refined its method durkheim maintained that the social sciences are a logical continuation of the natural ones into the realm of human activity and insisted that they should retain the same objectivity rationalism and approach to causality he developed the notion of objective sui generis  social facts  to delineate a unique empirical object for the science of sociology to study
the variety of positivism that remains dominant today is termed instrumental positivism this approach eschews epistemological and metaphysical concerns  such as the nature of social facts  in favour of methodological clarity replicability reliability and validity this positivism is more or less synonymous with quantitative research and so only resembles older positivism in practice since it carries no explicit philosophical commitment its practitioners may not belong to any particular school of thought modern sociology of this type is often credited to paul lazarsfeld who pioneered large-scale survey studies and developed statistical techniques for analysing them this approach lends itself to what robert k merton called middle-range theory  abstract statements that generalize from segregated hypotheses and empirical regularities rather than starting with an abstract idea of a social whole
reactions against social empiricism began when german philosopher hegel voiced opposition to both empiricism which he rejected as uncritical and determinism which he viewed as overly mechanistic karl marx s methodology borrowed from hegelian dialecticism but also a rejection of positivism in favour of critical analysis seeking to supplement the empirical acquisition of  facts  with the elimination of illusions he maintained that appearances need to be critiqued rather than simply documented early hermeneuticians such as wilhelm dilthey pioneered the distinction between natural and social science   geisteswissenschaft   various neo-kantian philosophers phenomenologists and human scientists further theorized how the analysis of the social world differs to that of the natural world due to the irreducibly complex aspects of human society culture and being
at the turn of the 20th century the first generation of german sociologists formally introduced methodological anti-positivism proposing that research should concentrate on human cultural norms values symbols and social processes viewed from a resolutely subjective perspective max weber argued that sociology may be loosely described as a science as it is able to identify causal relationships of human  social action  especially among  ideal types  or hypothetical simplifications of complex social phenomena as a non-positivist however weber sought relationships that are not as  historical invariant or generalisable  as those pursued by natural scientists fellow german sociologist ferdinand t nnies theorized on two crucial abstract concepts with his work on  gemeinschaft and gesellschaft   lit community and society  t nnies marked a sharp line between the realm of concepts and the reality of social action  the first must be treated axiomatically and in a deductive way   pure sociology   whereas the second empirically and inductively   applied sociology  
both weber and georg simmel pioneered the  verstehen   or  interpretative   method in social science  a systematic process by which an outside observer attempts to relate to a particular cultural group or indigenous people on their own terms and from their own point of view through the work of simmel in particular sociology acquired a possible character beyond positivist data-collection or grand deterministic systems of structural law relatively isolated from the sociological academy throughout his lifetime simmel presented idiosyncratic analyses of modernity more reminiscent of the phenomenological and existential writers than of comte or durkheim paying particular concern to the forms of and possibilities for social individuality his sociology engaged in a neo-kantian inquiry into the limits of perception asking  what is society   in a direct allusion to kant s question  what is nature  
other developments
the first college course entitled  sociology  was taught in the united states at yale in 1875 by william graham sumner in 1883 lester f ward the first president of the american sociological association published dynamic sociology or applied social science as based upon statical sociology and the less complex sciences and attacked the laissez-faire sociology of herbert spencer and sumner ward s 1200 page book was used as core material in many early american sociology courses in 1890 the oldest continuing american course in the modern tradition began at the university of kansas lectured by frank w blackmar the department of sociology at the university of chicago was established in 1892 by albion small who also published the first sociology textbook  an introduction to the study of society 1894 george herbert mead and charles cooley who had met at the university of michigan in 1891  along with john dewey  would move to chicago in 1894 their influence gave rise to social psychology and the symbolic interactionism of the modern chicago school the american journal of sociology was founded in 1895 followed by the american sociological association  asa  in 1905 the sociological  canon of classics  with durkheim and max weber at the top owes in part to talcott parsons who is largely credited with introducing both to american audiences parsons consolidated the sociological tradition and set the agenda for american sociology at the point of its fastest disciplinary growth sociology in the united states was less historically influenced by marxism than its european counterpart and to this day broadly remains more statistical in its approach
the first sociology department to be established in the united kingdom was at the london school of economics and political science  home of the british journal of sociology  in 1904 leonard trelawny hobhouse and edvard westermarck became the lecturers in the discipline at the university of london in 1907 harriet martineau an english translator of comte has been cited as the first female sociologist in 1909 the deutsche gesellschaft f r soziologie  german sociological association  was founded by ferdinand t nnies and max weber among others weber established the first department in germany at the ludwig maximilian university of munich in 1919 having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology in 1920 florian znaniecki set up the first department in poland the institute for social research at the university of frankfurt  later to become the frankfurt school of critical theory  was founded in 1923 international co-operation in sociology began in 1893 when ren  worms founded the institut international de sociologie an institution later eclipsed by the much larger international sociological association  isa  founded in 1949
theoretical traditions
classical theory
the contemporary discipline of sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic as a result of the contentions of classical social theory in randall collins  well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions  functionalism conflict symbolic interactionism and utilitarianism modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist  durkheim  and conflict-centred  marx and weber  accounts of social structure as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural  simmel  and pragmatist  mead cooley  theories of social interaction utilitarianism also known as rational choice or social exchange although often associated with economics is an established tradition within sociological theory lastly as argued by raewyn connell a tradition that is often forgotten is that of social darwinism which brings the logic of darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies this tradition often aligns with classical functionalism it was the dominant theoretical stance in american sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology primarily herbert spencer lester f ward and william graham sumner contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive
a broad historical paradigm in both sociology and anthropology functionalism addresses the social structure referred to as social organization in among the classical theorists as a whole and in terms of the necessary function of its constituent elements a common analogy  popularized by herbert spencer  is to regard norms and institutions as  organs  that work towards the proper-functioning of the entire  body  of society the perspective was implicit in the original sociological positivism of comte but was theorized in full by durkheim again with respect to observable structural laws functionalism also has an anthropological basis in the work of theorists such as marcel mauss bronis aw malinowski and radcliffe-brown it is in radcliffe-brown s specific usage that the prefix  structural  emerged classical functionalist theory is generally united by its tendency towards biological analogy and notions of social evolutionism in that the basic form of society would increase in complexity and those forms of social organization that promoted solidarity would eventually overcome social disorganization as giddens states   functionalist thought from comte onwards has looked particularly towards biology as the science providing the closest and most compatible model for social science biology has been taken to provide a guide to conceptualizing the structure and the function of social systems and to analysing processes of evolution via mechanisms of adaptation  functionalism strongly emphasizes the pre-eminence of the social world over its individual parts  ie its constituent actors human subjects  
functionalist theories emphasize  cohesive systems  and are often contrasted with  conflict theories  which critique the overarching socio-political system or emphasize the inequality between particular groups the following quotes from durkheim and marx epitomize the political as well as theoretical disparities between functionalist and conflict thought respectively 
symbolic interaction  often associated with interactionism phenomenological sociology dramaturgy interpretivism is a sociological tradition that places emphasis on subjective meanings and the empirical unfolding of social processes generally accessed through micro-analysis this tradition emerged in the chicago school of the 1920s and 1930s which prior to world war ii  had been the center of sociological research and graduate study  the approach focuses on creating a framework for building a theory that sees society as the product of the everyday interactions of individuals society is nothing more than the shared reality that people construct as they interact with one another this approach sees people interacting in countless settings using symbolic communications to accomplish the tasks at hand therefore society is a complex ever-changing mosaic of subjective meanings some critics of this approach argue that it only looks at what is happening in a particular social situation and disregards the effects that culture race or gender  ie social-historical structures  may have in that situation some important sociologists associated with this approach include max weber george herbert mead erving goffman george homans and peter blau it is also in this tradition that the radical-empirical approach of ethnomethodology emerges from the work of harold garfinkel
utilitarianism is often referred to as exchange theory or rational choice theory in the context of sociology this tradition tends to privilege the agency of individual rational actors and assumes that within interactions individuals always seek to maximize their own self-interest as argued by josh whitford rational actors are assumed to have four basic elements the individual has  1   a knowledge of alternatives   2   a knowledge of or beliefs about the consequences of the various alternatives   3   an ordering of preferences over outcomes   4   a decision rule to select among the possible alternatives  exchange theory is specifically attributed to the work of george c homans peter blau and richard emerson organizational sociologists james g march and herbert a simon noted that an individual s rationality is bounded by the context or organizational setting the utilitarian perspective in sociology was most notably revitalized in the late 20th century by the work of former asa president james coleman
20th-century social theory
following the decline of theories of sociocultural evolution in the united states the interactionism of the chicago school dominated american sociology as anselm strauss describes  we didn t think symbolic interaction was a perspective in sociology  we thought it was sociology  after world war ii mainstream sociology shifted to the survey-research of paul lazarsfeld at columbia university and the general theorizing of pitirim sorokin followed by talcott parsons at harvard university ultimately  the failure of the chicago columbia and wisconsin  departments to produce a significant number of graduate students interested in and committed to general theory in the years 1936 45 was to the advantage of the harvard department  as parsons began to dominate general theory his work predominately referenced european sociology almost entirely omitting citations of both the american tradition of sociocultural-evolution as well as pragmatism in addition to parsons  revision of the sociological canon  which included marshall pareto weber and durkheim  the lack of theoretical challenges from other departments nurtured the rise of the parsonian structural-functionalist movement which reached its crescendo in the 1950s but by the 1960s was in rapid decline
by the 1980s most functionalisms in europe had broadly been replaced by conflict-oriented approaches and to many in the discipline functionalism was considered  as dead as a dodo   according to giddens the orthodox consensus terminated in the late 1960s and 1970s as the middle ground shared by otherwise competing perspectives gave way and was replaced by a baffling variety of competing perspectives this third  generation  of social theory includes phenomenologically inspired approaches critical theory ethnomethodology symbolic interactionism structuralism post-structuralism and theories written in the tradition of hermeneutics and ordinary language philosophy 
while some conflict approaches also gained popularity in the united states the mainstream of the discipline instead shifted to a variety of empirically oriented middle-range theories with no single overarching or  grand  theoretical orientation john levi martin refers to this  golden age of methodological unity and theoretical calm  as the pax wisconsana as it reflected the composition of the sociology department at the university of wisconsin madison  numerous scholars working on separate projects with little contention omar lizardo describes the pax wisconsana as   a midwestern flavored mertonian resolution of the theory method wars in which  all agreed on at least two working hypotheses   1  grand theory  is a waste of time   2   good theory has to be good to think with or goes in the trash bin  despite the aversion to grand theory in the later half of the 20th century several new traditions have emerged that propose various syntheses  structuralism post-structuralism cultural sociology and systems theory
the structuralist movement originated primarily from the work of durkheim as interpreted by two european anthropologists anthony giddens  theory of structuration draws on the linguistic theory of ferdinand de saussure and the french anthropologist claude l vi-strauss in this context  structure  refers not to  social structure  but to the semiotic understanding of human culture as a system of signs one may delineate four central tenets of structuralism  first structure is what determines the structure of a whole second structuralists believe that every system has a structure third structuralists are interested in  structural  laws that deal with coexistence rather than changes finally structures are the  real things  beneath the surface or the appearance of meaning
the second tradition of structuralist thought contemporaneous with giddens emerges from the american school of social network analysis spearheaded by the harvard department of social relations led by harrison white and his students in the 1970s and 1980s this tradition of structuralist thought argues that rather than semiotics social structure is networks of patterned social relations and rather than levi-strauss this school of thought draws on the notions of structure as theorized by levi-strauss  contemporary anthropologist radcliffe-brown some refer to this as  network structuralism  and equate it to  british structuralism  as opposed to the  french structuralism  of levi-strauss
post-structuralist thought has tended to reject  humanist  assumptions in the conduct of social theory michel foucault provides a potent critique in his archaeology of the human sciences though habermas and rorty have both argued that foucault merely replaces one such system of thought with another the dialogue between these intellectuals highlights a trend in recent years for certain schools of sociology and philosophy to intersect the anti-humanist position has been associated with  postmodernism  a term used in specific contexts to describe an era or phenomena but occasionally construed as a method
central theoretical problems
overall there is a strong consensus regarding the central problems of sociological theory which are largely inherited from the classical theoretical traditions this consensus is  how to link transcend or cope with the following  big three  dichotomies  subjectivity and objectivity structure and agency and synchrony and diachrony the first deals with knowledge the second with action and the last with time lastly sociological theory often grapples with the problem of integrating or transcending the divide between micro meso and macro-scale social phenomena which is a subset of all three central problems
subjectivity and objectivity
the problem of subjectivity and objectivity can be divided into a concern over the general possibilities of social actions and on the other hand the specific problem of social scientific knowledge in the former the subjective is often equated  though not necessarily  with the individual and the individual s intentions and interpretations of the objective the objective is often considered any public or external action or outcome on up to society writ large a primary question for social theorists is how knowledge reproduces along the chain of subjective-objective-subjective that is to say  how is intersubjectivity achieved  while historically qualitative methods have attempted to tease out subjective interpretations quantitative survey methods also attempt to capture individual subjectivities also some qualitative methods take a radical approach to objective description in situ
the latter concern with scientific knowledge results from the fact that a sociologist is part of the very object they seek to explain bourdieu puts this problem rather succinctly 
structure and agency
structure and agency sometimes referred to as determinism versus voluntarism form an enduring ontological debate in social theory   do social structures determine an individual s behaviour or does human agency   in this context  agency  refers to the capacity of individuals to act independently and make free choices whereas  structure  relates to factors that limit or affect the choices and actions of individuals  such as social class religion gender ethnicity and so on  discussions over the primacy of either structure and agency relate to the core of sociological epistemology   what is the social world made of    what is a cause in the social world and what is an effect    a perennial question within this debate is that of  social reproduction   how are structures  specifically structures producing inequality  reproduced through the choices of individuals 
synchrony and diachrony
synchrony and diachrony or statics and dynamics within social theory are terms that refer to a distinction emerging out of the work of levi-strauss who inherited it from the linguistics of ferdinand de saussure the former slices moments of time for analysis thus it is an analysis of static social reality diachrony on the other hand attempts to analyse dynamic sequences following saussure synchrony would refer to social phenomena as a static concept like a language while diachrony would refer to unfolding processes like actual speech in anthony giddens  introduction to central problems in social theory he states that  in order to show the interdependence of action and structure  we must grasp the time space relations inherent in the constitution of all social interaction  and like structure and agency time is integral to discussion of social reproduction in terms of sociology historical sociology is often better positioned to analyse social life as diachronic while survey research takes a snapshot of social life and is thus better equipped to understand social life as synchronized some argue that the synchrony of social structure is a methodological perspective rather than an ontological claim nonetheless the problem for theory is how to integrate the two manners of recording and thinking about social data
research methodology
many people divide sociological research methods into two broad categories although many others see research methods as a continuum 
many sociologists are divided into camps of support for particular research techniques these disputes relate to the epistemological debates at the historical core of social theory while very different in many aspects both qualitative and quantitative approaches involve a systematic interaction between theory and data quantitative methodologies hold the dominant position in sociology especially in the united states in the discipline s two most cited journals quantitative articles have historically outnumbered qualitative ones by a factor of two  most articles published in the largest british journal on the other hand are qualitative  most textbooks on the methodology of social research are written from the quantitative perspective and the very term  methodology  is often used synonymously with  statistics  practically all sociology phd programmes in the united states require training in statistical methods the work produced by quantitative researchers is also deemed more  trustworthy  and  unbiased  by the greater public though this judgment continues to be challenged by antipositivists
the choice of method often depends largely on what the researcher intends to investigate for example a researcher concerned with drawing a statistical generalization across an entire population may administer a survey questionnaire to a representative sample population by contrast a researcher who seeks full contextual understanding of an individual s social actions may choose ethnographic participant observation or open-ended interviews studies will commonly combine or  triangulate  quantitative and qualitative methods as part of a  multi-strategy  design for instance a quantitative study may be performed to gain statistical patterns or a target sample and then combined with a qualitative interview to determine the play of agency
sampling
quantitative methods are often used to ask questions about a population that is very large making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population infeasible a  sample  then forms a manageable subset of a population in quantitative research statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole the process of selecting a sample is referred to as  sampling  while it is usually best to sample randomly concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling conversely the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling
methods
the following list of research methods is neither exclusive nor exhaustive 
computational sociology
sociologists increasingly draw upon computationally intensive methods to analyse and model social phenomena using computer simulations artificial intelligence text mining complex statistical methods and new analytic approaches like social network analysis and social sequence analysis computational sociology develops and tests theories of complex social processes through bottom-up modelling of social interactions
although the subject matter and methodologies in social science differ from those in natural science or computer science several of the approaches used in contemporary social simulation originated from fields such as physics and artificial intelligence by the same token some of the approaches that originated in computational sociology have been imported into the natural sciences such as measures of network centrality from the fields of social network analysis and network science in relevant literature computational sociology is often related to the study of social complexity social complexity concepts such as complex systems non-linear interconnection among macro and micro process and emergence have entered the vocabulary of computational sociology a practical and well-known example is the construction of a computational model in the form of an  artificial society  by which researchers can analyse the structure of a social system
scope and topics
culture
sociologists  approach to culture can be divided into a  sociology of culture  and  cultural sociology  the terms are similar though not entirely interchangeable the sociology of culture is an older term and considers some topics and objects as more-or-less  cultural  than others conversely cultural sociology sees all social phenomena as inherently cultural sociology of culture often attempts to explain certain cultural phenomena as a product of social processes while cultural sociology sees culture as a potential explanation of social phenomena
for simmel culture referred to  the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history  while early theorists such as durkheim and mauss were influential in cultural anthropology sociologists of culture are generally distinguished by their concern for modern  rather than primitive or ancient  society cultural sociology often involves the hermeneutic analysis of words artefacts and symbols or ethnographic interviews however some sociologists employ historical-comparative or quantitative techniques in the analysis of culture weber and bourdieu for instance the subfield is sometimes allied with critical theory in the vein of theodor w adorno walter benjamin and other members of the frankfurt school loosely distinct from the sociology of culture is the field of cultural studies birmingham school theorists such as richard hoggart and stuart hall questioned the division between  producers  and  consumers  evident in earlier theory emphasizing the reciprocity in the production of texts cultural studies aims to examine its subject matter in terms of cultural practices and their relation to power for example a study of a subculture  such as white working class youth in london  would consider the social practices of the group as they relate to the dominant class the  cultural turn  of the 1960s ultimately placed culture much higher on the sociological agenda
sociology of literature film and art is a subset of the sociology of culture this field studies the social production of artistic objects and its social implications a notable example is pierre bourdieu s 1992 les r gles de l art  gen se et structure du champ litt raire translated by susan emanuel as rules of art  genesis and structure of the literary field  1996  none of the founding fathers of sociology produced a detailed study of art but they did develop ideas that were subsequently applied to literature by others marx s theory of ideology was directed at literature by pierre macherey terry eagleton and fredric jameson weber s theory of modernity as cultural rationalization which he applied to music was later applied to all the arts literature included by frankfurt school writers such as adorno and j rgen habermas durkheim s view of sociology as the study of externally defined social facts was redirected towards literature by robert escarpit bourdieu s own work is clearly indebted to marx weber and durkheim
criminality deviance law and punishment
criminologists analyse the nature causes and control of criminal activity drawing upon methods across sociology psychology and the behavioural sciences the sociology of deviance focuses on actions or behaviours that violate norms including both formally enacted rules  eg crime  and informal violations of cultural norms it is the remit of sociologists to study why these norms exist  how they change over time  and how they are enforced the concept of social disorganization is when the broader social systems leads to violations of norms for instance robert k merton produced a typology of deviance which includes both individual and system level causal explanations of deviance
the study of law played a significant role in the formation of classical sociology durkheim famously described law as the  visible symbol  of social solidarity the sociology of law refers to both a sub-discipline of sociology and an approach within the field of legal studies sociology of law is a diverse field of study that examines the interaction of law with other aspects of society such as the development of legal institutions and the effect of laws on social change and vice versa for example an influential recent work in the field relies on statistical analyses to argue that the increase in incarceration in the us over the last 30 years is due to changes in law and policing and not to an increase in crime  and that this increase significantly contributes to maintaining racial stratification
communications and information technologies
the sociology of communications and information technologies includes  the social aspects of computing the internet new media computer networks and other communication and information technologies 
the internet is of interest to sociologists in various ways  most practically as a tool for research and as a discussion platform the sociology of the internet in the broad sense regards the analysis of online communities  eg newsgroups social networking sites  and virtual worlds thus there is often overlap with community sociology online communities may be studied statistically through network analysis or interpreted qualitatively through virtual ethnography moreover organizational change is catalysed through new media thereby influencing social change at-large perhaps forming the framework for a transformation from an industrial to an informational society one notable text is manuel castells  the internet galaxy the title of which forms an inter-textual reference to marshall mcluhan s the gutenberg galaxy closely related to the sociology of the internet is digital sociology which expands the scope of study to address not only the internet but also the impact of the other digital media and devices that have emerged since the first decade of the twenty-first century
as with cultural studies media study is a distinct discipline that owes to the convergence of sociology and other social sciences and humanities in particular literary criticism and critical theory though the production process or the critique of aesthetic forms is not in the remit of sociologists analyses of socializing factors such as ideological effects and audience reception stem from sociological theory and method thus the  sociology of the media  is not a subdiscipline per se but the media is a common and often-indispensable topic
economic sociology
the term  economic sociology  was first used by william stanley jevons in 1879 later to be coined in the works of durkheim weber and simmel between 1890 and 1920 economic sociology arose as a new approach to the analysis of economic phenomena emphasizing class relations and modernity as a philosophical concept the relationship between capitalism and modernity is a salient issue perhaps best demonstrated in weber s the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism  1905  and simmel s the philosophy of money  1900  the contemporary period of economic sociology also known as new economic sociology was consolidated by the 1985 work of mark granovetter titled  economic action and social structure  the problem of embeddedness  this work elaborated the concept of embeddedness which states that economic relations between individuals or firms take place within existing social relations  and are thus structured by these relations as well as the greater social structures of which those relations are a part  social network analysis has been the primary methodology for studying this phenomenon granovetter s theory of the strength of weak ties and ronald burt s concept of structural holes are two best known theoretical contributions of this field
the sociology of work or industrial sociology examines  the direction and implications of trends in technological change globalization labour markets work organization managerial practices and employment relations to the extent to which these trends are intimately related to changing patterns of inequality in modern societies and to the changing experiences of individuals and families the ways in which workers challenge resist and make their own contributions to the patterning of work and shaping of work institutions

the sociology of education is the study of how educational institutions determine social structures experiences and other outcomes it is particularly concerned with the schooling systems of modern industrial societies a classic 1966 study in this field by james coleman known as the  coleman report  analysed the performance of over 150,000 students and found that student background and socioeconomic status are much more important in determining educational outcomes than are measured differences in school resources  ie per pupil spending  the controversy over  school effects  ignited by that study has continued to this day the study also found that socially disadvantaged black students profited from schooling in racially mixed classrooms and thus served as a catalyst for desegregation busing in american public schools
environment
environmental sociology is the study of human interactions with the natural environment typically emphasizing human dimensions of environmental problems social impacts of those problems and efforts to resolve them as with other sub-fields of sociology scholarship in environmental sociology may be at one or multiple levels of analysis from global  eg world-systems  to local societal to individual attention is paid also to the processes by which environmental problems become defined and known to humans as argued by notable environmental sociologist john bellamy foster the predecessor to modern environmental sociology is marx s analysis of the metabolic rift which influenced contemporary thought on sustainability environmental sociology is often interdisciplinary and overlaps with the sociology of risk rural sociology and the sociology of disaster
human ecology deals with interdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments in addition to environmental sociology this field overlaps with architectural sociology urban sociology and to some extent visual sociology in turn visual sociology which is concerned with all visual dimensions of social life overlaps with media studies in that it uses photography film and other technologies of media
family gender and sexuality
family gender and sexuality form a broad area of inquiry studied in many sub-fields of sociology a family is a group of people who are related by kinship ties  - relations of blood   marriage   civil partnership or adoption the family unit is one of the most important social institutions found in some form in nearly all known societies it is the basic unit of social organization and plays a key role in socializing children into the culture of their society the sociology of the family examines the family as an institution and unit of socialization with special concern for the comparatively modern historical emergence of the nuclear family and its distinct gender roles the notion of  childhood  is also significant as one of the more basic institutions to which one may apply sociological perspectives the sociology of the family is a common component on introductory academic curricula feminist sociology on the other hand is a normative sub-field that observes and critiques the cultural categories of gender and sexuality particularly with respect to power and inequality the primary concern of feminist theory is the patriarchy and the systematic oppression of women apparent in many societies both at the level of small-scale interaction and in terms of the broader social structure feminist sociology also analyses how gender interlocks with race and class to produce and perpetuate social inequalities  how to account for the differences in definitions of femininity and masculinity and in sex role across different societies and historical periods  is also a concern social psychology of gender on the other hand uses experimental methods to uncover the microprocesses of gender stratification for example one recent study has shown that resume evaluators penalize women for motherhood while giving a boost to men for fatherhood
health illness and the body
the sociology of health and illness focuses on the social effects of and public attitudes toward illnesses diseases mental health and disabilities this sub-field also overlaps with gerontology and the study of the ageing process medical sociology by contrast focuses on the inner-workings of medical organizations and clinical institutions in britain sociology was introduced into the medical curriculum following the goodenough report  1944 
the sociology of the body and embodiment takes a broad perspective on the idea of  the body  and includes  a wide range of embodied dynamics including human and non-human bodies morphology human reproduction anatomy body fluids biotechnology genetics this often intersects with health and illness but also theories of bodies as political social cultural economic and ideological productions the isa maintains a research committee devoted to  the body in the social sciences 
a subfield of the sociology of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology is the study of death dying and bereavement sometimes referred to broadly as the sociology of death this topic is exemplifed by the work of douglas davies and michael c kearl
knowledge and science
the sociology of knowledge is the study of the relationship between human thought and the social context within which it arises and of the effects prevailing ideas have on societies the term first came into widespread use in the 1920s when a number of german-speaking theorists most notably max scheler and karl mannheim wrote extensively on it with the dominance of functionalism through the middle years of the 20th century the sociology of knowledge tended to remain on the periphery of mainstream sociological thought it was largely reinvented and applied much more closely to everyday life in the 1960s particularly by peter l berger and thomas luckmann in the social construction of reality  1966  and is still central for methods dealing with qualitative understanding of human society  compare socially constructed reality  the  archaeological  and  genealogical  studies of michel foucault are of considerable contemporary influence
the sociology of science involves the study of science as a social activity especially dealing  with the social conditions and effects of science and with the social structures and processes of scientific activity  important theorists in the sociology of science include robert k merton and bruno latour these branches of sociology have contributed to the formation of science and technology studies both the asa and the bsa have sections devoted to the subfield of science knowledge and technology the isa maintains a research committee on science and technology
leisure
sociology of leisure is the study of how humans organize their free time leisure includes a broad array of activities such as sport tourism and the playing of games the sociology of leisure is closely tied to the sociology of work as each explores a different side of the work leisure relationship more recent studies in the field move away from the work leisure relationship and focus on the relation between leisure and culture this area of sociology began with thorstein veblen s theory of the leisure class
peace war and conflict
this subfield of sociology studies broadly the dynamics of war conflict resolution peace movements war refugees conflict resolution and military institutions as a subset of this subfield military sociology aims towards the systematic study of the military as a social group rather than as an organization it is a highly specialized sub-field which examines issues related to service personnel as a distinct group with coerced collective action based on shared interests linked to survival in vocation and combat with purposes and values that are more defined and narrow than within civil society military sociology also concerns civilian-military relations and interactions between other groups or governmental agencies topics include the dominant assumptions held by those in the military changes in military members  willingness to fight military unionization military professionalism the increased utilization of women the military industrial-academic complex the military s dependence on research and the institutional and organizational structure of military
political sociology
historically political sociology concerned the relations between political organization and society a typical research question in this area might be   why do so few american citizens choose to vote   in this respect questions of political opinion formation brought about some of the pioneering uses of statistical survey research by paul lazarsfeld a major subfield of political sociology developed in relation to such questions which draws on comparative history to analyse socio-political trends the field developed from the work of max weber and moisey ostrogorsky
contemporary political sociology includes these areas of research but it has been opened up to wider questions of power and politics today political sociologists are as likely to be concerned with how identities are formed that contribute to structural domination by one group over another  the politics of who knows how and with what authority  and questions of how power is contested in social interactions in such a way as to bring about widespread cultural and social change such questions are more likely to be studied qualitatively the study of social movements and their effects has been especially important in relation to these wider definitions of politics and power
political sociology has also moved beyond methodological nationalism and analysed the role of non-governmental organizations the diffusion of the nation-state throughout the earth as a social construct and the role of stateless entities in the modern world society contemporary political sociologists also study inter-state interactions and human rights
population and demography
demographers or sociologists of population study the size composition and change over time of a given population demographers study how these characteristics impact or are impacted by various social economic or political systems the study of population is also closely related to human ecology and environmental sociology which studies a populations relationship with the surrounding environment and often overlaps with urban or rural sociology researchers in this field may study the movement of populations  transportation migrations diaspora etc which falls into the subfield known as mobilities studies and is closely related to human geography demographers may also study spread of disease within a given population or epidemiology
public sociology
public sociology refers to an approach to the discipline which seeks to transcend the academy in order to engage with wider audiences it is perhaps best understood as a style of sociology rather than a particular method theory or set of political values this approach is primarily associated with michael burawoy who contrasted it with professional sociology a form of academic sociology that is concerned primarily with addressing other professional sociologists public sociology is also part of the broader field of science communication or science journalism in a distinct but similar vein applied sociology also known as clinical sociology policy sociology or sociological practice applies knowledge derived from sociological research to solve societal problems
race and ethnic relations
the sociology of race and of ethnic relations is the area of the discipline that studies the social political and economic relations between races and ethnicities at all levels of society this area encompasses the study of racism residential segregation and other complex social processes between different racial and ethnic groups this research frequently interacts with other areas of sociology such as stratification and social psychology as well as with postcolonial theory at the level of political policy ethnic relations are discussed in terms of either assimilationism or multiculturalism anti-racism forms another style of policy particularly popular in the 1960s and 70s
religion
the sociology of religion concerns the practices historical backgrounds developments universal themes and roles of religion in society there is particular emphasis on the recurring role of religion in all societies and throughout recorded history the sociology of religion is distinguished from the philosophy of religion in that sociologists do not set out to assess the validity of religious truth-claims instead assuming what peter l berger has described as a position of  methodological atheism  it may be said that the modern formal discipline of sociology began with the analysis of religion in durkheim s 1897 study of suicide rates among roman catholic and protestant populations max weber published four major texts on religion in a context of economic sociology and social stratification  the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism  1905  the religion of china  confucianism and taoism  1915  the religion of india  the sociology of hinduism and buddhism  1915  and ancient judaism  1920  contemporary debates often centre on topics such as secularization civil religion the intersection of religion and economics and the role of religion in a context of globalization and multiculturalism
social change and development
the sociology of change and development attempts to understand how societies develop and how they can be changed within this field sociologists often use macrosociological methods or historical-comparative methods in contemporary studies of social change there is overlaps with international development or community development however most of the founders of sociology had theories of social change based on their study of history for instance marx contended that the material circumstances of society ultimately caused the ideal or cultural aspects of society while weber argued that it was in fact the cultural mores of protestantism that ushered in a transformation of material circumstances in contrast to both durkheim argued that societies moved from simple to complex through a process of sociocultural evolution sociologists in this field also study processes of globalization and imperialism most notably immanuel wallerstein extends marx s theoretical frame to include large spans of time and the entire globe in what is known as world systems theory development sociology is also heavily influenced by post-colonialism in recent years raewyn connell issued a critique of the bias in sociological research towards countries in the global north she argues that this bias blinds sociologists to the lived experiences of the global south specifically so-called  northern theory  lacks an adequate theory of imperialism and colonialism
social networks
a social network is a social structure composed of individuals  or organizations  called  nodes  which are tied  connected  by one or more specific types of interdependency such as friendship kinship financial exchange dislike sexual relationships or relationships of beliefs knowledge or prestige social networks operate on many levels from families up to the level of nations and play a critical role in determining the way problems are solved organizations are run and the degree to which individuals succeed in achieving their goals an underlying theoretical assumption of social network analysis is that groups are not necessarily the building blocks of society  the approach is open to studying less-bounded social systems from non-local communities to networks of exchange drawing theoretically from relational sociology social network analysis avoids treating individuals  persons organizations states  as discrete units of analysis it focuses instead on how the structure of ties affects and constitutes individuals and their relationships in contrast to analyses that assume that socialization into norms determines behaviour network analysis looks to see the extent to which the structure and composition of ties affect norms on the other hand recent research by omar lizardo also demonstrates that network ties are shaped and created by previously existing cultural tastes social network theory is usually defined in formal mathematics and may include integration of geographical data into sociomapping
social psychology
sociological social psychology focuses on micro-scale social actions this area may be described as adhering to  sociological miniaturism  examining whole societies through the study of individual thoughts and emotions as well as behaviour of small groups of special concern to psychological sociologists is how to explain a variety of demographic social and cultural facts in terms of human social interaction some of the major topics in this field are social inequality group dynamics prejudice aggression social perception group behaviour social change non-verbal behaviour socialization conformity leadership and social identity social psychology may be taught with psychological emphasis in sociology researchers in this field are the most prominent users of the experimental method  however unlike their psychological counterparts they also frequently employ other methodologies  social psychology looks at social influences as well as social perception and social interaction
stratification poverty and inequality
social stratification is the hierarchical arrangement of individuals into social classes castes and divisions within a society modern western societies stratification traditionally relates to cultural and economic classes arranged in three main layers  upper class middle class and lower class but each class may be further subdivided into smaller classes  eg occupational  social stratification is interpreted in radically different ways within sociology proponents of structural functionalism suggest that since the stratification of classes and castes is evident in all societies hierarchy must be beneficial in stabilizing their existence conflict theorists by contrast critique the inaccessibility of resources and lack of social mobility in stratified societies
karl marx distinguished social classes by their connection to the means of production in the capitalist system  the bourgeoisie own the means but this effectively includes the proletariat itself as the workers can only sell their own labour power  forming the material base of the cultural superstructure  max weber critiqued marxist economic determinism arguing that social stratification is not based purely on economic inequalities but on other status and power differentials  eg patriarchy  according to weber stratification may occur among at least three complex variables   1  property  class   a person s economic position in a society based on birth and individual achievement weber differs from marx in that he does not see this as the supreme factor in stratification weber noted how managers of corporations or industries control firms they do not own  marx would have placed such a person in the proletariat  2  prestige  status   a person s prestige or popularity in a society this could be determined by the kind of job this person does or wealth and  3  power  political party   a person s ability to get their way despite the resistance of others for example individuals in state jobs such as an employee of the federal bureau of investigation or a member of the united states congress may hold little property or status but they still hold immense power pierre bourdieu provides a modern example in the concepts of cultural and symbolic capital theorists such as ralf dahrendorf have noted the tendency towards an enlarged middle-class in modern western societies particularly in relation to the necessity of an educated work force in technological or service-based economies perspectives concerning globalization such as dependency theory suggest this effect owes to the shift of workers to the developing countries
urban and rural sociology
urban sociology involves the analysis of social life and human interaction in metropolitan areas it is a discipline seeking to provide advice for planning and policy making after the industrial revolution works such as georg simmel s the metropolis and mental life  1903  focused on urbanization and the effect it had on alienation and anonymity in the 1920s and 1930s the chicago school produced a major body of theory on the nature of the city important to both urban sociology and criminology utilizing symbolic interactionism as a method of field research contemporary research is commonly placed in a context of globalization for instance in saskia sassen s study of the  global city  rural sociology by contrast is the analysis of non-metropolitan areas as agriculture and wilderness tend to be a more prominent social fact in rural regions rural sociologists often overlap with environmental sociologists
often grouped with urban and rural sociology is that of community sociology or the sociology of community taking various communities including online communities as the unit of analysis community sociologists study the origin and effects of different associations of people for instance german sociologist ferdinand t nnies distinguished between two types of human association  gemeinschaft  usually translated as  community   and gesellschaft   society  or  association   in his 1887 work gemeinschaft und gesellschaft t nnies argued that gemeinschaft is perceived to be a tighter and more cohesive social entity due to the presence of a  unity of will  the  development  or  health  of a community is also a central concern of community sociologists also engage in development sociology exemplified by the literature surrounding the concept of social capital
violence
the late political theorist hannah arendt wrote widely on the connection between power and violence in particular her book on violence
other academic disciplines
sociology overlaps with a variety of disciplines that study society in particular anthropology political science economics social work and social philosophy many comparatively new fields such as communication studies cultural studies demography and literary theory draw upon methods that originated in sociology the terms  social science  and  social research  have both gained a degree of autonomy since their origination in classical sociology the distinct field of social psychology emerged from the many intersections of sociological and psychological interests and is further distinguished in terms of sociological or psychological emphasis
sociology and applied sociology are connected to the professional and academic discipline of social work both disciplines study social interactions community and the effect of various systems  ie family school community laws political sphere  on the individual however social work is generally more focused on practical strategies to alleviate social dysfunctions  sociology in general provides a thorough examination of the root causes of these problems for example a sociologist might study why a community is plagued with poverty the applied sociologist would be more focused on practical strategies on what needs to be done to alleviate this burden the social worker would be focused on action  implementing theses strategies  directly  or  indirectly  by means of mental health therapy counselling advocacy community organization or community mobilization
social anthropology is the branch of anthropology that studies how contemporary living human beings behave in social groups practitioners of social anthropology like sociologists investigate various facets of social organization traditionally social anthropologists analysed non-industrial and non-western societies whereas sociologists focused on industrialized societies in the western world in recent years however social anthropology has expanded its focus to modern western societies meaning that the two disciplines increasingly converge
sociobiology is the study of how social behaviour and organization have been influenced by evolution and other biological process the field blends sociology with a number of other sciences such as anthropology biology and zoology sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general  see  nature versus nurture   entomologist e o wilson is credited as having originally developed and described sociobiology besides sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication plant communication fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use in this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial  syntactic  context-dependent  pragmatic  and content-relevant  semantic  rules
irving louis horowitz in his the decomposition of sociology  1994  has argued that the discipline while arriving from a  distinguished lineage and tradition  is in decline due to deeply ideological theory and a lack of relevance to policy making   the decomposition of sociology began when this great tradition became subject to ideological thinking and an inferior tradition surfaced in the wake of totalitarian triumphs  furthermore   a problem yet unmentioned is that sociology s malaise has left all the social sciences vulnerable to pure positivism to an empiricism lacking any theoretical basis talented individuals who might in an earlier time have gone into sociology are seeking intellectual stimulation in business law the natural sciences and even creative writing  this drains sociology of much needed potential  horowitz cites the lack of a  core discipline  as exacerbating the problem randall collins the dorothy swaine thomas professor in sociology at the university of pennsylvania and a member of the advisory editors council of the social evolution   history journal has voiced similar sentiments   we have lost all coherence as a discipline we are breaking up into a conglomerate of specialities each going on its own way and with none too high regard for each other 
in 2007 the times higher education guide published a list of  the most cited authors of books in the humanities   including philosophy and psychology  seven of the top ten are listed as sociologists  michel foucault  1  pierre bourdieu  2  anthony giddens  5  erving goffman  6  j rgen habermas  7  max weber  8  and bruno latour  10
