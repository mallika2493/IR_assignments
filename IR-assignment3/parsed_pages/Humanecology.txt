human ecology - wikipedia
human ecology is an interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary study of the relationship between humans and their natural social and built environments the philosophy and study of human ecology has a diffuse history with advancements in geography sociology psychology anthropology zoology epidemiology public health home economics and natural ecology among others


historical development
the roots of ecology as a broader discipline can be traced to the greeks and a lengthy list of developments in natural history science ecology also has notably developed in other cultures traditional knowledge as it is called includes the human propensity for intuitive knowledge intelligent relations understanding and for passing on information about the natural world and the human experience the term ecology was coined by ernst haeckel in 1866 and defined by direct reference to the economy of nature
like other contemporary researchers of his time haeckel adopted his terminology from carl linnaeus where human ecological connections were more evident in his 1749 publication specimen academicum de oeconomia naturae linnaeus developed a science that included the economy and polis of nature polis stems from its greek roots for a political community  originally based on the city-states  sharing its roots with the word police in reference to the promotion of growth and maintenance of good social order in a community linnaeus was also the first to write about the close affinity between humans and primates linnaeus presented early ideas found in modern aspects to human ecology including the balance of nature while highlighting the importance of ecological functions  ecosystem services or natural capital in modern terms    in exchange for performing its function satisfactorily nature provided a species with the necessaries of life  66 the work of linnaeus influenced charles darwin and other scientists of his time who used linnaeus  terminology  ie the economy and polis of nature  with direct implications on matters of human affairs ecology and economics
ecology is not just biological but a human science as well an early and influential social scientist in the history of human ecology was herbert spencer spencer was influenced by and reciprocated his influence onto the works of charles darwin herbert spencer coined the phrase  survival of the fittest  he was an early founder of sociology where he developed the idea of society as an organism and he created an early precedent for the socio-ecological approach that was the subsequent aim and link between sociology and human ecology
the history of human ecology has strong roots in geography and sociology departments of the late 19th century in this context a major historical development or landmark that stimulated research into the ecological relations between humans and their urban environments was founded in george perkins marsh s book man and nature  or physical geography as modified by human action which was published in 1864 marsh was interested in the active agency of human-nature interactions  an early precursor to urban ecology or human niche construction  in frequent reference to the economy of nature
in 1894 an influential sociologist at the university of chicago named albion w small collaborated with sociologist george e vincent and published a    laboratory guide   to studying people in their   every-day occupations    578 this was a guidebook that trained students of sociology how they could study society in a way that a natural historian would study birds their publication  explicitly included the relation of the social world to the material environment  578
the first english-language use of the term  ecology  is credited to american chemist and founder of the field of home economics ellen swallow richards richards first introduced the term as  oekology  in 1892 and subsequently developed the term  human ecology 
the term  human ecology  was published in 1907 in ellen swallow richards work  sanitation in daily life  defined there as  the study of the surroundings of human beings in the effects they produce on the lives of men  richard s use of the term recognized humans as part of rather than separate from nature the term made its first formal appearance in the field of sociology in the 1921 book  introduction to the science of sociology  published by robert e park and ernest w burgess  also from the sociology department at the university of chicago  their student roderick d mckenzie helped solidify human ecology as a sub-discipline within the chicago school these authors emphasized the difference between human ecology and ecology in general by highlighting cultural evolution in human societies
human ecology has a fragmented academic history with developments spread throughout a range of disciplines including  home economics geography anthropology sociology zoology and psychology some authors have argued that geography is human ecology much historical debate has hinged on the placement of humanity as part or as separate from nature  in light of the branching debate of what constitutes human ecology recent interdisciplinary researchers have sought a unifying scientific field they have titled coupled human and natural systems that  builds on but moves beyond previous work  eg human ecology ecological anthropology environmental geography   639 other fields or branches related to the historical development of human ecology as a discipline include cultural ecology urban ecology environmental sociology and anthropological ecology
biological ecologists have traditionally been reluctant to study human ecology gravitating instead to the allure of wild nature human ecology has a history of focusing attention on humans  impact on the biotic world paul sears was an early proponent of applying human ecology addressing topics aimed at the population explosion of humanity global resource limits pollution and published a comprehensive account on human ecology as a discipline in 1954 he saw the vast  explosion  of problems humans were creating for the environment and reminded us that  what is important is the work to be done rather than the label   when we as a profession learn to diagnose the total landscape not only as the basis of our culture but as an expression of it and to share our special knowledge as widely as we can we need not fear that our work will be ignored or that our efforts will be unappreciated  963
overview
human ecology has been defined as a type of analysis applied to the relations in human beings that was traditionally applied to plants and animals in ecology toward this aim human ecologists  which can include sociologists  integrate diverse perspectives from a broad spectrum of disciplines covering  wider points of view  107 in its 1972 premier edition the editors of human ecology  an interdisciplinary journal gave an introductory statement on the scope of topics in human ecology their statement provides a broad overview on the interdisciplinary nature of the topic 
forty years later in the same journal daniel g bates  2012  notes lines of continuity in the discipline and the way it has changed 
while theoretical discussions continue research published in human ecology review suggests that recent discourse has shifted toward applying principles of human ecology some of these applications focus instead on addressing problems that cross disciplinary boundaries or transcend those boundaries altogether scholarship has increasingly tended away from gerald l young s idea of a  unified theory  of human ecological knowledge that human ecology may emerge as its own discipline and more toward the pluralism best espoused by paul shepard  that human ecology is healthiest when  running out in all directions  but human ecology is neither anti-discipline nor anti-theory rather it is the ongoing attempt to formulate synthesize and apply theory to bridge the widening schism between man and nature this new human ecology emphasizes complexity over reductionism focuses on changes over stable states and expands ecological concepts beyond plants and animals to include people
application to epidemiology and public health
the application of ecological concepts to epidemiology has similar roots to those of other disciplinary applications with carl linnaeus having played a seminal role however the term appears to have come into common use in the medical and public health literature in the mid-twentieth century this was strengthened in 1971 by the publication of epidemiology as medical ecology and again in 1987 by the publication of a textbook on public health and human ecology an  ecosystem health  perspective has emerged as a thematic movement integrating research and practice from such fields as environmental management public health biodiversity and economic development drawing in turn from the application of concepts such as the social-ecological model of health human ecology has converged with the mainstream of global public health literature
connection to home economics
in addition to its links to other disciplines human ecology has a strong historical linkage to the field of home economics through the work of ellen swallow richards among others however as early as the 1960s a number of universities began to rename  home economics  departments schools and colleges as  human ecology  programs in part this name change was a response to perceived difficulties with the term  home economics  in a modernizing society and reflects a recognition of  human ecology  as one of the initial choices for the discipline which was to become  home economics  current human ecology programs include cornell university college of human ecology and the university of alberta s department of human ecology among others
niche of the anthropocene
changes to the earth by human activities have been so great that a new geological epoch named the anthropocene has been proposed the human niche or ecological polis of human society as it was known historically has created entirely new arrangements of ecosystems as we convert matter into technology human ecology has created anthropogenic biomes  called anthromes  the habitats within these anthromes reach out through our road networks to create what has been called technoecosystems containing technosols technodiversity exists within these technoecosystems in direct parallel to the concept of the ecosphere human civilization has also created a technosphere the way that the human species engineers or constructs technodiversity into the environment threads back into the processes of cultural and biological evolution including the human economy
ecosystem services
the ecosystems of planet earth are coupled to human environments ecosystems regulate the global geophysical cycles of energy climate soil nutrients and water that in turn support and grow natural capital  including the environmental physiological cognitive cultural and spiritual dimensions of life  ultimately every manufactured product in human environments comes from natural systems ecosystems are considered common-pool resources because ecosystems do not exclude beneficiaries and they can be depleted or degraded for example green space within communities provides sustainable health services that reduces mortality and regulates the spread of vector borne disease research shows that people who are more engaged with regular access to natural areas have lower rates of diabetes heart disease and psychological disorders these ecological health services are regularly depleted through urban development projects that do not factor in the common-pool value of ecosystems
the ecological commons delivers a diverse supply of community services that sustains the well-being of human society the millennium ecosystem assessment an international un initiative involving more than 1,360 experts worldwide identifies four main ecosystem service types having 30 sub-categories stemming from natural capital the ecological commons includes provisioning  eg food raw materials medicine water supplies  regulating  eg climate water soil retention flood retention  cultural  eg science and education artistic spiritual  and supporting  eg soil formation nutrient cycling water cycling  services
sixth mass extinction
global assessments of biodiversity indicate that the current epoch the holocene  or anthropocene  is a sixth mass extinction species loss is accelerating at 100 1000 times faster than average background rates in the fossil record the field of conservation biology involves ecologists that are researching confronting and searching for solutions to sustain the planet s ecosystems for future generations
nature is a resilient system ecosystems regenerate withstand and are forever adapting to fluctuating environments ecological resilience is an important conceptual framework in conservation management and it is defined as the preservation of biological relations in ecosystems that persevere and regenerate in response to disturbance over time however persistent systematic large and nonrandom disturbance caused by the niche constructing behavior of human beings habitat conversion and land development has pushed many of the earth s ecosystems to the extent of their resilient thresholds three planetary thresholds have already been crossed including 1  biodiversity loss 2  climate change and 3  nitrogen cycles these biophysical systems are ecologically interrelated and naturally resilient but human civilization has transitioned the planet to an anthropocene epoch where the threshold for planetary scale resilience has been crossed and the ecological state of the earth is deteriorating rapidly to the detriment of humanity the world s fisheries and oceans for example are facing dire challenges as the threat of global collapse appears imminent with serious ramifications for the well-being of humanity  while the anthropocene is yet to be classified as an official epoch current evidence suggest that  an epoch-scale boundary has been crossed within the last two centuries  835 the ecology of the planet is further threatened by global warming but investments in nature conservation can provide a regulatory feedback to store and regulate carbon and other greenhouse gases
ecological footprint
in 1992 william rees developed the ecological footprint concept the ecological footprint and its close analog the water footprint has become a popular way of accounting for the level of impact that human society is imparting on the earth s ecosystems all indications are that the human enterprise is unsustainable as the footprint of society is placing too much stress on the ecology of the planet the wwf 2008 living planet report and other researchers report that human civilization has exceeded the bio-regenerative capacity of the planet this means that the footprint of human consumption is extracting more natural resources than can be replenished by ecosystems around the world
ecological economics
ecological economics is an economic science that extends its methods of valuation onto nature in an effort to address the inequity between market growth and biodiversity loss natural capital is the stock of materials or information stored in biodiversity that generates services that can enhance the welfare of communities population losses are the more sensitive indicator of natural capital than are species extinction in the accounting of ecosystem services the prospect for recovery in the economic crisis of nature is grim populations such as local ponds and patches of forest are being cleared away and lost at rates that exceed species extinctions the mainstream growth-based economic system adopted by governments worldwide does not include a price or markets for natural capital this type of economic system places further ecological debt onto future generations
human societies are increasingly being placed under stress as the ecological commons is diminished through an accounting system that has incorrectly assumed   that nature is a fixed indestructible capital asset  44 the current wave of threats including massive extinction rates and concurrent loss of natural capital to the detriment of human society is happening rapidly this is called a biodiversity crisis because 50  of the worlds species are predicted to go extinct within the next 50 years conventional monetary analyses are unable to detect or deal with these sorts of ecological problems multiple global ecological economic initiatives are being promoted to solve this problem for example governments of the g8 met in 2007 and set forth the economics of ecosystems and biodiversity  teeb  initiative 
the work of kenneth e boulding is notable for building on the integration between ecology and its economic origins boulding drew parallels between ecology and economics most generally in that they are both studies of individuals as members of a system and indicated that the  household of man  and the  household of nature  could somehow be integrated to create a perspective of greater value
interdisciplinary approaches
human ecology expands functionalism from ecology to the human mind people s perception of a complex world is a function of their ability to be able to comprehend beyond the immediate both in time and in space this concept manifested in the popular slogan promoting sustainability   think global act local  moreover people s conception of community stems from not only their physical location but their mental and emotional connections and varies from  community as place community as way of life or community of collective action 
in these early years human ecology was still deeply enmeshed in its respective disciplines  geography sociology anthropology psychology and economics scholars through the 1970s until present have called for a greater integration between all of the scattered disciplines that has each established formal ecological research
in art
while some of the early writers considered how art fit into a human ecology it was sears who posed the idea that in the long run human ecology will in fact look more like art bill carpenter  1986  calls human ecology the  possibility of an aesthetic science  renewing dialogue about how art fits into a human ecological perspective according to carpenter human ecology as an aesthetic science counters the disciplinary fragmentation of knowledge by examining human consciousness
in education
while the reputation of human ecology in institutions of higher learning is growing there is no human ecology at the primary and secondary education levels educational theorist sir kenneth robinson has called for diversification of education to promote creativity in academic and non-academic  ie- educate their  whole being   activities to implement a  new conception of human ecology 
bioregionalism and urban ecology
in the late 1960s ecological concepts started to become integrated into the applied fields namely architecture landscape architecture and planning ian mcharg called for a future when all planning would be  human ecological planning  by default always bound up in humans  relationships with their environments he emphasized local place-based planning that takes into consideration all the  layers  of information from geology to botany to zoology to cultural history proponents of the new urbanism movement like james howard kunstler and andres duany have embraced the term human ecology as way to describe the problem of and prescribe the solutions for the landscapes and lifestyles of an automobile oriented society duany has called the human ecology movement to be  the agenda for the years ahead  while mchargian planning is still widely respected the landscape urbanism movement seeks a new understanding between human and environment relations among these theorists is frederich steiner who published human ecology  following nature s lead in 2002 which focuses on the relationships among landscape culture and planning the work highlights the beauty of scientific inquiry by revealing those purely human dimensions which underlie our concepts of ecology while steiner discusses specific ecological settings such as cityscapes and waterscapes and the relationships between socio-cultural and environmental regions he also takes a diverse approach to ecology considering even the unique synthesis between ecology and political geography deiter steiner s 2003 human ecology  fragments of anti-fragmentary view of the world is an important expose of recent trends in human ecology part literature review the book is divided into four sections   human ecology   the implicit and the explicit   structuration  and  the regional dimension  much of the work stresses the need for transciplinarity antidualism and wholeness of perspective
