work
club of rome

the limits to growth
the limits to growth is a 1972 book modeling the consequences of a rapidly growing world population and finite resource supplies commissioned by the club of rome meadows coauthored the book with donella h meadows j rgen randers and william w behrens iii
the book used the world3 model to simulate the consequence of interactions between the earth s and human systems the book echoes some of the concerns and predictions of the reverend thomas robert malthus in an essay on the principle of population  1798 
the eventual purpose of the limits to growth was not to make specific predictions but to explore how exponential growth interacts with finite resources because the size of resources is not known only the general behavior can be explored
the 30-year update
there has been a major cultural shift in the thinking about global processes in the last three decades of the 20th century in an 2004 interview meadows explained 
in their 1972 publication limits to growth their recommendations were focused on  how to slow growth  in the 2004 limits to growth   the 30-year update the message has changed meadows explained   now we must tell people how to manage an orderly reduction of their activities back down below the limits of the earth s resources  
in 2014 research at the university of melbourne confirmed that the predictions from the book limits to growth were largely correct presently we are very close to tracking  business-as-usual  scenario from the book
