ipcc fifth assessment report - wikipedia
the fifth assessment report  ar5  of the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc  is the fifth in a series of such reports the ipcc was established in 1988 by the world meteorological organization  wmo  and the united nations environment programme  unep  to assess scientific technical and socio-economic information concerning climate change its potential effects and options for adaptation and mitigation
the fifth assessment report was finalized in 2014 as had been the case in the past the outline of the ar5 was developed through a scoping process which involved climate change experts from all relevant disciplines and users of ipcc reports  in particular representatives from governments governments and organizations involved in the fourth report were asked to submit comments and observations in writing with the submissions analysed by the panel the report was delivered in stages starting with working group i s report on the physical science basis based on 9,200 peer-reviewed studies the summaries for policy makers were released on 27 september 2013 for the first report on 31 march 2014 for the second report entitled  impacts adaptation and vulnerability  and on 14 april 2014 for the third report entitled  mitigation of climate change  the synthesis report was released on 2 november 2014 in time to pave the way for negotiations on reducing carbon emissions at the un climate change conference in paris during late 2015
current status
the fifth assessment report  ar5  consists of three working group  wg  reports and a synthesis report the first working group report was published in 2013 and the rest were completed in 2014
the ar5 provides an update of knowledge on the scientific technical and socio-economic aspects of climate change
more than 800 authors selected from around 3,000 nominations were involved in writing the report lead authors  meetings and a number of workshops and expert meetings in support of the assessment process were held a schedule of ar5 related meetings review periods and other important dates was published
on 14 december 2012 drafts of the working group 1  wg1  report were leaked and posted on the internet the release of the summary for policymakers occurred on 27 september 2013 halld r thorgeirsson a un official warned that because big companies are known to fund the undermining of climate science scientists should be prepared for an increase in negative publicity at the time  vested interests are paying for the discrediting of scientists all the time we need to be ready for that  he said
marking the finalization of the physical science basis un secretary general ban ki-moon addressed the ipcc at stockholm on 27 september 2013 he stated that  the heat is on we must act  jennifer morgan from the world resources institute said  hopefully the ipcc will inspire leadership from the mom to the business leader to the mayor to the head of state  us secretary of state john kerry responded to the report saying  this is yet another wakeup call  those who deny the science or choose excuses over action are playing with fire 
authors and editors
in march 2010 the ipcc received approximately 3,000 author nominations from experts around the world at the bureau session held in geneva 19 20 may 2010 the three working groups presented their selected authors and review editors for the ar5 each of the selected scientists specialists and experts was nominated in accordance with ipcc procedures by respective national ipcc focal-points by approved observer organizations or by the bureau the ipcc received 50  more nominations of experts to participate in ar5 than it did for ar4 a total of 559 authors and review editors had been selected for ar4 from 2,000 proposed nominees on 23 june 2010 the ipcc announced the release of the final list of selected coordinating lead authors comprising 831 experts who were drawn from fields including meteorology physics oceanography statistics engineering ecology social sciences and economics in comparison to the fourth assessment report  ar4  participation from developing countries was increased reflecting the ongoing efforts to improve regional coverage in the ar5 about 30  of authors came from developing countries or economies in transition more than 60  of the experts chosen were new to the ipcc process bringing fresh knowledge and perspectives
climate change 2013  report overview
on 23 june 2010 the ipcc announced the release of the final list of selected coordinating lead authors comprising 831 experts the working group reports would be published during 2013 and 2014 these experts would also provide contributions to the synthesis report published in late 2014
the fifth assessment report  climate change 2013  would be released in four distinct sections 
working group i contribution
the full text of climate change 2013  the physical science basis was released in an unedited form on monday 30 september 2013 it was over 2000 pages long and cited 9200 scientific publications the full edited report was released online in january 2014 and published in physical form by cambridge university press later in the year
a concise overview of working group i s findings was published as the summary for policymakers on 27 september 2013 the level of confidence in each finding was rated on a confidence scale qualitatively from very low to very high and where possible quantitatively from exceptionally unlikely to virtually certain  determined based on statistical analysis and expert judgement 
the principal findings were 
ar5 relies on the coupled model intercomparison project phase 5  cmip5  an international effort among the climate modeling community to coordinate climate change experiments most of the cmip5 and earth system model  esm  simulations for ar5 wri were performed with prescribed co2 concentrations reaching 421 ppm  rcp2.6  538 ppm  rcp4.5  670 ppm  rcp6.0  and 936 ppm  rcp 8.5  by the year 2100  ipcc ar5 wgi page 22 
the summary also detailed the range of forecasts for warming and climate impacts with different emission scenarios compared to the previous report the lower bounds for the sensitivity of the climate system to emissions were slightly lowered though the projections for global mean temperature rise  compared to pre-industrial levels  by 2100 exceeded 1.5  c in all scenarios
other
the  next generation earth system models   eg hadgem2  can produce hundreds of terabytes to perhaps tens of petabytes of climate model data for analysis
climate model simulations in support of ar5 use a different approach to account for increasing greenhouse gas concentrations than in the previous report instead of the scenarios from the special report on emissions scenarios the models are performing simulations for various representative concentration pathways
public debate after the publication of ar4 in 2009 put the ipcc under scrutiny with controversies over alleged bias and inaccuracy in its reports in 2010 this prompted un secretary-general ban ki-moon and ipcc chair rajendra k pachauri to request that the interacademy council  iac  review the ipcc and recommend ways to strengthen its processes and procedures for the preparation of ar5 the iac report made recommendations to fortify ipcc s management structure to further develop its conflict-of-interest policy to strengthen the review process to clarify the guidelines on the use of so-called gray literature to ensure consistency in the use of probabilities for the likelihood of outcomes and to improve its communications strategy especially regarding transparency and rapidity of response

condensed versions
the climate and development knowledge network has produced region-specific toolkits for policy makers practitioners journalists and teachers based on the findings in the fifth assessment report they include summary reports which distill the key findings of the ipcc report  as well as media materials such as infographics slideshow presentations and images which can be used for training educational and reporting purposes the four toolkits that have been developed are
