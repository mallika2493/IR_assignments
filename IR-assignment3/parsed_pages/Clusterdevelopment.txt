while the purpose of cluster initiative organizations is to promote economic development within the cluster by improving the competitiveness of one or several specific business sectors it is important to differentiate these public-private organizations from policy-making organizations at different levels eg national government units such as the uk department of trade and industry  dti  and supranational bodies such as the oecd and the european commission and from industry associations comprising firms within one business sector eg biotech steel
more specifically cluster initiatives are organizations or projects that are organized as collaborations between a diverse number of public and private sector actors such as firms government agencies and academic institutions whereas lobbying policymakers may be one of the cluster initiative s activities cluster initiatives generally are involved in a broad range of activities eg supply-chain development market intelligence incubator services attraction of foreign direct investment management training joint r d projects marketing of the region and setting technical standards
