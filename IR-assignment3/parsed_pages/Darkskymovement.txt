dark-sky movement - wikipedia
the dark-sky movement is a campaign to reduce light pollution the advantages of reducing light pollution include an increased number of stars visible at night reducing the effects of electric lighting on the environment and cutting down on energy usage earth hour and national dark-sky week are two examples of such efforts
the movement started with professional and amateur astronomers alarmed that nocturnal skyglow from urban areas was blotting out the sight of stars for example the world-famous palomar observatory in california is threatened by sky-glow from the nearby city of escondido and local businesses for similar reasons astronomers in arizona helped push the governor there to veto a bill in 2012 which would have lifted a ban on illuminated billboards
nocturnal animals can be harmed by light pollution because they are biologically evolved to be dependent on an environment with a certain amount of hours of uninterrupted daytime and nighttime the over-illumination of the night sky is affecting these organisms  especially birds  this biological study of darkness is called scotobiology light pollution has also been found to affect human circadian rhythms
the dark-sky movement encourages the use of full-cutoff fixtures that cast little or no light upward in public areas and generally to encourage communities to adopt lighting regulations a 2011 project is to establish  dark sky oasis  in suburban areas


skyglow
skyglow is the illumination of the night sky or parts of it resembling an orange  smog  it occurs from both natural and human-made sources artificial skyglow is caused by the over-illumination of the sky from large city centres shopping centres or stadiums it consists of light that is either emitted directly upward or reflected from the ground that is then scattered by dust and gas molecules in the atmosphere producing a luminous background or light dome these artificial skyglows cause the sky to be 5 10 times brighter in urban areas than a naturally dark sky that is unaffected by artificial light natural skyglow can come from natural light sources such as the sun the moon the stars or auroras
some communities are becoming aware of this problem and are putting forth efforts to minimize the hazy orange skyglow a community in particular is the city of merritt british columbia an article published july 8 2010 states that they are making minor changes to lighting in and around merritt such as the installment of down-cast lighting to commercial buildings as part of their light pollution abatement program the benefits of this technological change include  saving energy through better focused lights preserving the environment by reducing excess light that may affect flora and fauna reducing crime and increasing safety by more adequately illuminating areas and reducing health risks 
scotobiology
scotobiology is the study of the role darkness plays in living organisms and shows that interrupting darkness by light pollution creates drastic effects for most organisms  changing their food gathering and feeding habits their mating and reproduction behavior migration behaviour  birds and insects  and social behavior approximately 30  of vertebrates and 60  of invertebrates are nocturnal meaning that they depend on darkness their everyday behaviors are biologically evolved to adapt in uninterrupted darkness
human health is also adversely affected by the effects of light pollution light during night time hours has been linked to human cancers and psychological disorders
dark-sky preserves
dark-sky preserves are the main contributors to the dark-sky movement they are protected areas found mostly in national parks that have a zero light pollution policy set in by the government and controlled by the national dark sky association
as of february 6 2012 there were 35 formally recognized dark-sky preserves in the world with canada in the lead containing 15 preserves these preserves are located in nova scotia new brunswick quebec ontario saskatchewan alberta and british columbia other countries that have dark-sky preserves are the czech republic hungary poland slovakia spain united kingdom and the united states a current list of designated parks is maintained by the dark skies advisory group  of the international union for conservation of nature  iucn 
the parks are put in place by the dark sky places program with the intention to remind us that the night sky serves just as much importance to our culture and history as our day-time sky
international dark-sky association
the international dark-sky association  ida  began in 1988 a non-profit it manages the fixture seal of approval program which offers a third-party rating system judging the  sky-friendliness  of lighting fixtures in 2009 the ida opened an office for public policy and government affairs in washington dc to inform lawmakers and lobbyists about the energy efficiency of outdoor lighting and to promote the adoption of energy-saving measures the ida has implemented several simple guidelines to responsible outdoor lighting along with some practical considerations
