amazon rainforest - wikipedia
the amazon rainforest  portuguese  floresta amaz nica or amaz nia  spanish  selva amaz nica amazon a or usually amazonia  french  for t amazonienne  dutch  amazoneregenwoud  also known in english as amazonia or the amazon jungle is a moist broadleaf forest that covers most of the amazon basin of south america this basin encompasses 7,000,000 square kilometres  2,700,000 sq mi  of which 5,500,000 square kilometres  2,100,000 sq mi  are covered by the rainforest this region includes territory belonging to nine nations the majority of the forest is contained within brazil with 60  of the rainforest followed by peru with 13  colombia with 10  and with minor amounts in venezuela ecuador bolivia guyana suriname and french guiana states or departments in four nations contain  amazonas  in their names the amazon represents over half of the planet s remaining rainforests and comprises the largest and most biodiverse tract of tropical rainforest in the world with an estimated 390 billion individual trees divided into 16,000 species


etymology
the name amazon is said to arise from a war francisco de orellana fought with the tapuyas and other tribes the women of the tribe fought alongside the men as was their custom orellana derived the name amazonas from the amazons of greek mythology described by herodotus and diodorus
history
natural
the rainforest likely formed during the eocene era it appeared following a global reduction of tropical temperatures when the atlantic ocean had widened sufficiently to provide a warm moist climate to the amazon basin the rainforest has been in existence for at least 55 million years and most of the region remained free of savanna-type biomes at least until the current ice age when the climate was drier and savanna more widespread
following the cretaceous paleogene extinction event the extinction of the dinosaurs and the wetter climate may have allowed the tropical rainforest to spread out across the continent from 66 34 mya the rainforest extended as far south as 45  climate fluctuations during the last 34 million years have allowed savanna regions to expand into the tropics during the oligocene for example the rainforest spanned a relatively narrow band it expanded again during the middle miocene then retracted to a mostly inland formation at the last glacial maximum however the rainforest still managed to thrive during these glacial periods allowing for the survival and evolution of a broad diversity of species
during the mid-eocene it is believed that the drainage basin of the amazon was split along the middle of the continent by the purus arch water on the eastern side flowed toward the atlantic while to the west water flowed toward the pacific across the amazonas basin as the andes mountains rose however a large basin was created that enclosed a lake  now known as the solim es basin within the last 5 10 million years this accumulating water broke through the purus arch joining the easterly flow toward the atlantic
there is evidence that there have been significant changes in amazon rainforest vegetation over the last 21,000 years through the last glacial maximum  lgm  and subsequent deglaciation analyses of sediment deposits from amazon basin paleolakes and from the amazon fan indicate that rainfall in the basin during the lgm was lower than for the present and this was almost certainly associated with reduced moist tropical vegetation cover in the basin there is debate however over how extensive this reduction was some scientists argue that the rainforest was reduced to small isolated refugia separated by open forest and grassland  other scientists argue that the rainforest remained largely intact but extended less far to the north south and east than is seen today this debate has proved difficult to resolve because the practical limitations of working in the rainforest mean that data sampling is biased away from the center of the amazon basin and both explanations are reasonably well supported by the available data
more than 56  of the dust fertilizing the amazon rainforest comes from the bod l  depression in northern chad in the sahara desert the dust contains phosphorus important for plant growth the yearly sahara dust replaces the equivalent amount of phosphorus washed away yearly in amazon soil from rains and floods up to 50 million tonnes of sahara dust per year are blown across the atlantic ocean nasa video
nasa s calipso satellite has measured the amount of dust transported by wind from the sahara to the amazon  an average 182 million tons of dust are windblown out of the sahara each year at 15 degrees west longitude across 1,600 miles  2,600 km  over the atlantic ocean  some dust falls into the atlantic  then at 35 degrees west longitude at the eastern coast of south america 27.7 million tons  15   of dust fall over the amazon basin 132 million tons of dust remain in the air 43 million tons of dust are windblown and falls on the caribbean sea past 75 degrees west longitude
calipso uses a laser range finder to scan the earth s atmosphere for the vertical distribution of dust and other aerosols calipso regularly tracks the sahara-amazon dust plume calipso has measured variations in the dust amounts transported  an 86 percent drop between the highest amount of dust transported in 2007 and the lowest in 2011
a possibility causing the variation is the sahel a strip of semi-arid land on the southern border of the sahara when rain amounts in the sahel are higher the volume of dust is lower the higher rainfall could make more vegetation grow in the sahel leaving less sand exposed to winds to blow away
human activity
based on archaeological evidence from an excavation at caverna da pedra pintada human inhabitants first settled in the amazon region at least 11,200 years ago subsequent development led to late-prehistoric settlements along the periphery of the forest by ad 1250 which induced alterations in the forest cover
for a long time it was thought that the amazon rainforest was only ever sparsely populated as it was impossible to sustain a large population through agriculture given the poor soil archeologist betty meggers was a prominent proponent of this idea as described in her book amazonia  man and culture in a counterfeit paradise she claimed that a population density of 0.2 inhabitants per square kilometre  0.52 sq mi  is the maximum that can be sustained in the rainforest through hunting with agriculture needed to host a larger population however recent anthropological findings have suggested that the region was actually densely populated some 5 million people may have lived in the amazon region in ad 1500 divided between dense coastal settlements such as that at maraj  and inland dwellers by 1900 the population had fallen to 1 million and by the early 1980s it was less than 200,000
the first european to travel the length of the amazon river was francisco de orellana in 1542 the bbc s unnatural histories presents evidence that orellana rather than exaggerating his claims as previously thought was correct in his observations that a complex civilization was flourishing along the amazon in the 1540s it is believed that the civilization was later devastated by the spread of diseases from europe such as smallpox
since the 1970s numerous geoglyphs have been discovered on deforested land dating between ad 1 1250 furthering claims about pre-columbian civilizations ondemar dias is accredited with first discovering the geoglyphs in 1977 and alceu ranzi with furthering their discovery after flying over acre the bbc s unnatural histories presented evidence that the amazon rainforest rather than being a pristine wilderness has been shaped by man for at least 11,000 years through practices such as forest gardening and terra preta terra preta is found over large areas in the amazon forest  and is now widely accepted as a product of indigenous soil management the development of this fertile soil allowed agriculture and silviculture in the previously hostile environment  meaning that large portions of the amazon rainforest are probably the result of centuries of human management rather than naturally occurring as has previously been supposed in the region of the xingu tribe remains of some of these large settlements in the middle of the amazon forest were found in 2003 by michael heckenberger and colleagues of the university of florida among those were evidence of roads bridges and large plazas
biodiversity
wet tropical forests are the most species-rich biome and tropical forests in the americas are consistently more species rich than the wet forests in africa and asia as the largest tract of tropical rainforest in the americas the amazonian rainforests have unparalleled biodiversity one in ten known species in the world lives in the amazon rainforest this constitutes the largest collection of living plants and animal species in the world
the region is home to about 2.5 million insect species tens of thousands of plants and some 2,000 birds and mammals to date at least 40,000 plant species 2,200 fishes 1,294 birds 427 mammals 428 amphibians and 378 reptiles have been scientifically classified in the region one in five of all the bird species in the world live in the rainforests of the amazon and one in five of the fish species live in amazonian rivers and streams scientists have described between 96,660 and 128,843 invertebrate species in brazil alone
the biodiversity of plant species is the highest on earth with one 2001 study finding a quarter square kilometer  62 acres  of ecuadorian rainforest supports more than 1,100 tree species a study in 1999 found one square kilometer  247 acres  of amazon rainforest can contain about 90,790 tonnes of living plants the average plant biomass is estimated at 356   47 tonnes per hectare to date an estimated 438,000 species of plants of economic and social interest have been registered in the region with many more remaining to be discovered or catalogued the total number of tree species in the region is estimated at 16,000
the green leaf area of plants and trees in the rainforest varies by about 25  as a result of seasonal changes leaves expand during the dry season when sunlight is at a maximum then undergo abscission in the cloudy wet season these changes provide a balance of carbon between photosynthesis and respiration
the rainforest contains several species that can pose a hazard among the largest predatory creatures are the black caiman jaguar cougar and anaconda in the river electric eels can produce an electric shock that can stun or kill while piranha are known to bite and injure humans various species of poison dart frogs secrete lipophilic alkaloid toxins through their flesh there are also numerous parasites and disease vectors vampire bats dwell in the rainforest and can spread the rabies virus malaria yellow fever and dengue fever can also be contracted in the amazon region
deforestation
deforestation is the conversion of forested areas to non-forested areas the main sources of deforestation in the amazon are human settlement and development of the land prior to the early 1960s access to the forest s interior was highly restricted and the forest remained basically intact farms established during the 1960s were based on crop cultivation and the slash and burn method however the colonists were unable to manage their fields and the crops because of the loss of soil fertility and weed invasion the soils in the amazon are productive for just a short period of time so farmers are constantly moving to new areas and clearing more land these farming practices led to deforestation and caused extensive environmental damage deforestation is considerable and areas cleared of forest are visible to the naked eye from outer space
in the 1970s construction began on the trans-amazonian highway this highway represented a major threat to the amazon rainforest fortunately for the rainforest the highway has not been completed hereby reducing the environmental damage
between 1991 and 2000 the total area of forest lost in the amazon rose from 415,000 to 587,000 square kilometres  160,000 to 227,000 sq mi  with most of the lost forest becoming pasture for cattle seventy percent of formerly forested land in the amazon and 91  of land deforested since 1970 is used for livestock pasture currently brazil is the second-largest global producer of soybeans after the united states new research however conducted by leydimere oliveira et al has shown that the more rainforest is logged in the amazon the less precipitation reaches the area and so the lower the yield per hectare becomes so despite the popular perception there has been no economical advantage for brazil from logging rainforest zones and converting these to pastoral fields
the needs of soy farmers have been used to justify many of the controversial transportation projects that are currently developing in the amazon the first two highways successfully opened up the rainforest and led to increased settlement and deforestation the mean annual deforestation rate from 2000 to 2005  22,392 km2 or 8,646 sq mi per year  was 18  higher than in the previous five years  19,018 km2 or 7,343 sq mi per year  although deforestation has declined significantly in the brazilian amazon between 2004 and 2014 there has been an increase to the present day
conservation and climate change
environmentalists are concerned about loss of biodiversity that will result from destruction of the forest and also about the release of the carbon contained within the vegetation which could accelerate global warming amazonian evergreen forests account for about 10  of the world s terrestrial primary productivity and 10  of the carbon stores in ecosystems of the order of 1.1   1011 metric tonnes of carbon amazonian forests are estimated to have accumulated 0.62   0.37 tons of carbon per hectare per year between 1975 and 1996
one computer model of future climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions shows that the amazon rainforest could become unsustainable under conditions of severely reduced rainfall and increased temperatures leading to an almost complete loss of rainforest cover in the basin by 2100 however simulations of amazon basin climate change across many different models are not consistent in their estimation of any rainfall response ranging from weak increases to strong decreases the result indicates that the rainforest could be threatened though the 21st century by climate change in addition to deforestation
in 1989 environmentalist cm peters and two colleagues stated there is economic as well as biological incentive to protecting the rainforest one hectare in the peruvian amazon has been calculated to have a value of  6820 if intact forest is sustainably harvested for fruits latex and timber   1000 if clear-cut for commercial timber  not sustainably harvested   or  148 if used as cattle pasture
as indigenous territories continue to be destroyed by deforestation and ecocide such as in the peruvian amazon indigenous peoples  rainforest communities continue to disappear while others like the urarina continue to struggle to fight for their cultural survival and the fate of their forested territories meanwhile the relationship between non-human primates in the subsistence and symbolism of indigenous lowland south american peoples has gained increased attention as have ethno-biology and community-based conservation efforts
from 2002 to 2006 the conserved land in the amazon rainforest has almost tripled and deforestation rates have dropped up to 60  about 1,000,000 square kilometres  250,000,000 acres  have been put onto some sort of conservation which adds up to a current amount of 1,730,000 square kilometres  430,000,000 acres 
a 2009 study found that a 4  c rise in global temperatures by 2100 would kill 85  of the amazon rainforest while a temperature rise of 3  c would kill some 75  of the amazon
remote sensing
the use of remotely sensed data is dramatically improving conservationists  knowledge of the amazon basin given the objectivity and lowered costs of satellite-based land cover analysis it appears likely that remote sensing technology will be an integral part of assessing the extent and damage of deforestation in the basin furthermore remote sensing is the best and perhaps only possible way to study the amazon on a large-scale
the use of remote sensing for the conservation of the amazon is also being used by the indigenous tribes of the basin to protect their tribal lands from commercial interests using handheld gps devices and programs like google earth members of the trio tribe who live in the rainforests of southern suriname map out their ancestral lands to help strengthen their territorial claims currently most tribes in the amazon do not have clearly defined boundaries making it easier for commercial ventures to target their territories
to accurately map the amazon s biomass and subsequent carbon related emissions the classification of tree growth stages within different parts of the forest is crucial in 2006 tatiana kuplich organized the trees of the amazon into four categories   1  mature forest  2  regenerating forest   3  regenerating forest  and  4  regenerating forest  the researcher used a combination of synthetic aperture radar  sar  and thematic mapper  tm  to accurately place the different portions of the amazon into one of the four classifications
impact of early 21st-century amazon droughts
in 2005 parts of the amazon basin experienced the worst drought in one hundred years and there were indications that 2006 could have been a second successive year of drought a july 23 2006 article in the uk newspaper the independent reported woods hole research center results showing that the forest in its present form could survive only three years of drought scientists at the brazilian national institute of amazonian research argue in the article that this drought response coupled with the effects of deforestation on regional climate are pushing the rainforest towards a  tipping point  where it would irreversibly start to die it concludes that the forest is on the brink of being turned into savanna or desert with catastrophic consequences for the world s climate
according to the world wide fund for nature the combination of climate change and deforestation increases the drying effect of dead trees that fuels forest fires
in 2010 the amazon rainforest experienced another severe drought in some ways more extreme than the 2005 drought the affected region was approximate 1,160,000 square miles  3,000,000 km2  of rainforest compared to 734,000 square miles  1,900,000 km2  in 2005 the 2010 drought had three epicenters where vegetation died off whereas in 2005 the drought was focused on the southwestern part the findings were published in the journal science in a typical year the amazon absorbs 1.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide  during 2005 instead 5 gigatons were released and in 2010 8 gigatons were released
