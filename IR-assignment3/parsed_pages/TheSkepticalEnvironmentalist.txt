the skeptical environmentalist - wikipedia
the skeptical environmentalist  measuring the real state of the world  danish  verdens sande tilstand literal translation  the true state of the world  is a book by danish environmentalist author bj rn lomborg controversial for its claims that overpopulation declining energy resources deforestation species loss water shortages certain aspects of global warming and an assortment of other global environmental issues are unsupported by analysis of the relevant data it was first published in danish in 1998 while the english edition was published as a work in environmental economics by cambridge university press in 2001
due to the scope of the project comprising the range of topics addressed the diversity of data and sources employed and the many types of conclusions and comments advanced the skeptical environmentalist does not fit easily into a particular scientific discipline or methodology although published by the social sciences division of cambridge university press the findings and conclusions were widely challenged on the basis of natural science this interpretation of the skeptical environmentalist as a work of environmental science generated much of the controversy and debate that surrounded the book


the author
prior to becoming the director of the copenhagen consensus center and adjunct professor at the copenhagen business school bj rn lomborg was an associate professor of political science at the university of aarhus
some critics focus on his lack of training or professional experience in the environmental sciences or economics supportersargue his research is an appropriate application of his expertise in cost-benefit analysis a standard analytical tool in policy assessment his advocates further note that many of the scientists and environmentalists who criticized the book are not themselves environmental policy experts or experienced in cost-benefit research
origins
in numerous interviews lomborg ascribed his motivation for writing the skeptical environmentalist to his personal convictions making clear that he was a pro-environmentalist and greenpeace supporter he has stated that he began his research as an attempt to counter what he saw as anti-ecological arguments by julian lincoln simon in an article in wired but changed his mind after starting to analyze data lomborg describes the views he attributes to environmental campaigners as the  litany  which he at one time claims to have affirmed but purports to correct in his work
methods
the general analytical approach employed by lomborg is based on cost-benefit analyses as employed in economics social science and the formulation and assessment of government policy much of lomborg s examination of his litany is based on statistical data analysis therefore his work may be considered a work of that nature since it examines the costs and benefits of its many topics it could be considered a work in economics as categorized by its publisher however the skeptical environmentalist is methodologically eclectic and cross-disciplinary combining interpretation of data with assessments of the media and human behavior evaluations of scientific theories and other approaches to arrive at its various conclusions
in arriving at the final work lomborg has used a similar approach in each of his work s main areas and subtopics he progresses from the general to the specific starting with a broad concern such as pollution or energy dividing it into subtopics  eg air pollution  fossil fuel depletion  and then identifying one or more widely held fears and their source  eg our air is growing increasingly toxic by x measure according to y  from there lomborg chooses data that he considers to be the most reliable and reasonable available he then analyzes that data to prove or disprove his selected proposition in every case his calculations find that the claim is not substantiated and is either an exaggeration or a completely reversed portrayal of an improving situation rather than a deteriorating one having established what he calls  the true state of the world  for each topic and subtopic lomborg examines a variety of theories technologies implementation strategies and costs and suggests alternative ways to improve not-so-dire situations or advance in other areas not currently considered as pressing
contents
the skeptical environmentalist s subtitle refers to the state of the world report published annually since 1984 by the worldwatch institute lomborg designated the report  one of the best-researched and academically most ambitious environmental policy publications  but criticized it for using short-term trends to predict disastrous consequences in cases where long-term trends would not support the same conclusions
in establishing its arguments the skeptical environmentalist examined a wide range of issues in the general area of environmental studies including environmental economics and science and came to an equally broad set of conclusions and recommendations lomborg s work directly challenged popular examples of green concerns by interpreting data from some 3,000 assembled sources the author suggested that environmentalists diverted potentially beneficial resources to less deserving environmental issues in ways that were economically damaging much of the book s methodology and integrity have been subject to criticism which argue that lomborg distorted the fields of research he covers support for the book was staunch as well
the litany
 the litany  comprises very diverse areas where lomborg claims overly pessimistic claims are made and bad policies are implemented as a result he cites accepted mainstream sources like the united states government united nations agencies and others preferring global long-term data over regional and short-term statistics
the skeptical environmentalist is arranged around four major themes 
lomborg s main argument is that the vast majority of environmental problems such as pollution water shortages deforestation and species loss as well as population growth hunger and aids are area-specific and highly correlated with poverty therefore challenges to human prosperity are essentially logistical matters and can be solved largely through economic and social development concerning problems that are more pressing at the global level such as the depletion of fossil fuels and global warming lomborg argues that these issues are often overstated and that recommended policies are often inappropriate if assessed against alternatives
lomborg analyzes three major themes  life expectancy food and hunger and prosperity finding that life expectancy and health levels have dramatically improved over the past centuries even though several regions of the world remain threatened in particular by aids he dismisses thomas malthus  theory that increases in the world s population lead to widespread hunger on the contrary lomborg claims that food is widespread and humanity s daily intake of calories is increasing and will continue to rise until hunger s eradication thanks to technological improvements in agriculture however lomborg notes that africa in particular still produces too little sustenance an effect he attributes to the continent s dismal economic and political systems concerning prosperity lomborg argues that wealth as measured by per capita gdp should not be the only judging criterion he points to improvements in education safety leisure and ever more widespread access to consumer goods as signs that prosperity is increasing in most parts of the world
in this section lomborg looks at the world s natural resources and draws a conclusion that contrasts starkly to that of the well known report the limits to growth first he analyzes food once more this time from an ecological perspective and again claims that most food products are not threatened by human growth an exception however is fish which continues to be depleted as a partial solution lomborg presents fish farms which cause a less disruptive impact on the world s oceans next lomborg looks at forests he finds no indication of widespread deforestation and notes that even the amazon still retains more than 80  of its 1978 tree cover lomborg points out that in developing countries deforestation is linked to poverty and poor economic conditions so he proposes that economic growth is the best means to tackle the loss of forests concerning energy lomborg asserts that oil is not being depleted as fast as is claimed and that improvements of technology will provide people with fossil fuels for years to come the author further asserts that many alternatives already exist and that with time they will replace fossil fuels as an energy source concerning other resources such as metals lomborg suggests that based on their price history they are not in short supply examining the challenge of collecting sufficient amounts of water lomborg says that wars will probably not erupt over water because fighting such wars is not cost-effective  one week of war with the palestinians for instance would cost israel more than five desalination plants according to an israeli officer  lomborg emphasizes the need for better water management as water is distributed unequally around the world
lomborg considers pollution from different angles he notes that air pollution in wealthy nations has steadily decreased in recent decades he finds that air pollution levels are highly linked to economic development with moderately developed countries polluting most again lomborg argues that faster growth in emerging countries would help them reduce their air pollution levels lomborg suggests that devoting resources to reduce the levels of specific air pollutants would provide the greatest health benefits and save the largest number of lives  per amount of money spent  continuing an already decades-long improvement in air quality in most developed countries concerning water pollution lomborg notes again that it is connected with economic progress he also notes that water pollution in major western rivers decreased rapidly after the use of sewage systems became widespread concerning waste lomborg notes once again that fears are overblown as the entire waste produced by the united states in the 21st century could fit into a square 100 feet thick and 28 km along each side or 0.009  of the total surface of the united states
in this last section lomborg puts forward his main assertion  based on a cost-benefit analysis the environmental threats to human prosperity are overstated and much of policy response is misguided as an example lomborg cites worries about pesticides and their link to cancer he argues that such concerns are vastly exaggerated in the public perception as alcohol and coffee are the foods that create by far the greatest risk of cancer as opposed to vegetables that have been sprayed with pesticides furthermore if pesticides were not used on fruit and vegetables their cost would rise and consequently their consumption would go down which would cause cancer rates to increase he goes on to criticize the fear of a vertiginous decline in biodiversity proposing that 0.7  of species have gone extinct in the last 50 years  as compared to a maximum of 50  as claimed by some biologists  while lomborg admits that extinctions are a problem he asserts that they are not the catastrophe claimed by some and have little effect on human prosperity
lomborg s most contentious assertion however involves global warming from the outset lomborg  accepts the reality of man-made global warming  though he refers to a number of uncertainties in the computer simulations of climate change and some aspects of data collection his main contention involves not the science of global warming but the politics and the policy response to scientific findings lomborg points out that given the amount of greenhouse gas reduction required to combat global warming the current kyoto protocol is grossly insufficient he argues that the economic costs of legislative restrictions that aim to slow or reverse global warming are far higher than the alternative of international coordination moreover he asserts that the cost of combating global warming would be disproportionately shouldered by developing countries lomborg proposes that since the kyoto agreement limits economic activities developing countries that suffer from pollution and poverty most will be perpetually handicapped economically
lomborg proposes that the importance of global warming in terms of policy priority is low compared to other policy issues such as fighting poverty disease and aiding poor countries which has direct and more immediate impact both in terms of welfare and the environment he therefore suggests that a global cost-benefit analysis be undertaken before deciding on future measures the copenhagen consensus that lomborg later organized concluded that combating global warming does have a benefit but its priority compared to other issues is  poor   ranked 13th  and three projects addressing climate change  optimal carbon tax the kyoto protocol and value-at-risk carbon tax  are the least cost-efficient of its proposals
conclusions
lomborg concludes his book by once again reviewing the litany and noting that the real state of the world is much better than the litany claims according to lomborg this discrepancy poses a problem as it focuses public attention on relatively unimportant issues while ignoring those that are paramount in the worst case the skeptical environmentalist argues the global community is pressured to adopt inappropriate policies which have adverse effects on humanity wasting resources that could be put to better use in aiding poor countries or fighting diseases such as aids lomborg thus urges us to look at what he calls the true problems of the world since solving those will also solve the litany
reaction
the skeptical environmentalist was controversial even before its english-language release with anti-publication efforts launched against cambridge university press once in the public arena the book elicited extreme reactions in scientific circles and in the mainstream media opinion was largely polarized environmental groups were generally critical
anti-publication pressures
dr chris harrison  publishing director of social science publishing for cambridge university press  anticipating the level of controversy a book like the skeptical environmentalist would likely provoke took extra care with the book s peer-review process instead of choosing candidates from the usual list of social science referees cambridge university press chose from a list provided by their environmental science publishing program four were chosen  a climate scientist an expert in biodiversity and sustainable development a specialist on the economics of climate change  whose credentials include reviewing publications for the un s intergovernmental panel on climate change  ipcc   and a  pure  economist all four members of cambridge s initial review panel agreed that the book should be published
while criticism of the book was to be expected the publisher was apparently surprised by the pressure brought against it to not publish the skeptical environmentalist the complaints of some critics included demands that cambridge convene a special panel to review the book in order to identify errors  despite existing pre-publication peer review  that cambridge transfer their publishing rights to a  non-scholarly publishing house  and that they review their own policies to prevent publication of any book described as  essentially a political tract  in the future
in the article entitled  peer review politics and pluralism  dr harrison noted that  many of the critical reviews of the skeptical environmentalist went beyond the usual unpicking of a thesis and concentrated instead on the role of the publisher in publishing the book at all the post tray and e-mail inbox of editors and senior managers at the press bore witness to a concerted campaign to persuade cambridge to renounce the book  he went on to describe complaints from environmentalists who feared the book would be  abused by corporate interests  cambridge university press felt it necessary to issue a formal written statement in order to  explain the editorial decisions that led not just to publishing the book but also to cambridge s resistance to concerted pressure to withdraw it from the market  with these complaints and the publication of a scientific american issue regarding the book  described below  cambridge stated in response to those who claimed the book lacked peer-review credentials  it would be quite wrong to abandon an author who had satisfied the requirements of our peer-review system 
cambridge took the additional step of inviting submissions of publishing proposals for books which offered an opposing argument to lomborg s but noted that they had to the best of chris harrison s knowledge seen no attempt by any of the critics to submit such a proposal this is seen by some to suggest that criticism of the book was political rather than academic subsequent to cambridge s unequivocal assertion that the skeptical environmentalist had been subject to peer-review harrison noted that
cambridge university press maintained their position and the book was published
the january 2002 issue of scientific american contained under the heading  misleading math about the earth  a set of essays by several scientists which claim that lomborg and the skeptical environmentalist misrepresent both scientific evidence and scientific opinion the magazine then refused lomborg s request to print a lengthy point-by-point rebuttal in his own defence on the grounds that the 32 pages would have taken a disproportionate share of the month s installment scientific american allowed lomborg a one-page defense in the may 2002 edition and then attempted to remove lomborg s publication of his complete response online citing a copyright violation after receiving much criticism the magazine published his complete rebuttal on its website along with the counter rebuttals of john rennie and john p holdren
nature also published a harsh review of lomborg s book in which stuart pimm of the center for environmental research and conservation at columbia university and jeff harvey of the netherlands institute of ecology wrote   the text employs the strategy of those who for example argue that gay men aren t dying of aids that jews weren t singled out by the nazis for extermination and so on   lomborg has also been criticized for using straw man arguments with charges that his litany of environmental doom-mongering does not accurately represent the mainstream views of the contemporary green movement
the  separately written expert reviews  further detail the various expert opinions peter gleick s assessment for example states 
jerry mahlman s appraisal of the chapter he was asked to evaluate states 
david pimentel who was repeatedly criticized in the book also wrote a critical review
one critical article  the skeptical environmentalist  a case study in the manufacture of news  attributes this media success to its initial influential supporters 
the media was criticized for the biased selection of reviewers and not informing readers of reviewers  background richard c bell writing for worldwatch noted that the wall street journal  instead of seeking scientists with a critical perspective  like many publications  put out reviews by people who were closely associated with lomborg  with the journal soliciting a review from the competitive enterprise institute s ronald bailey someone  who had earlier written a book called the true state of the world from which much of lomborg s claims were taken  bell also criticized the washington post whose sunday book world assigned the book review to dennis dutton identified as  a professor of philosophy who lectures on the dangers of pseudoscience at the science faculties of the university of canterbury in new zealand  and as the editor of the web site arts and letters daily bell noted that 
some critics of the skeptical environmentalist took issue not with the statistical investigation of lomborg s litany but with the suggestions and conclusions for which they were the foundation this line of criticism considered the book as a contribution to the policy debate over environment rather than the work of natural science in a bbc column from august 23 2001 veteran bbc environmental correspondent alex kirby wrote 
kirby s first concern was not with the extensive research and statistical analysis but the conclusions drawn from them 
on september 5 2001 at a lomborg book reading in england british environmentalist author mark lynas threw a cream pie in lomborg s face in a september 9 2001 article  why i pied lomborg  lynas stated 
the december 12 2001 issue of grist devoted an issue to the skeptical environmentalist with a series of essays from various scientists challenging individual sections a separate article examining the book s overall approach took issue with the framing of lomborg s conclusions 
addressing the apparent difficulty of scientists opposing the skeptical environmentalist in criticizing the book strictly on the basis of statistics and challenging the conclusions about areas of environmental sciences that were drawn from them lynas contends 
support
influential uk newsweekly the economist weighed in at the start with heavy support publishing an advance essay by lomborg in which he detailed his litany and following up with a highly favorable review and supportive coverage it stated that  this is one of the most valuable books on public policy not merely environmental policy  to have been written for the intelligent general reader in the past ten yearsthe skeptical environmentalist is a triumph 
among the general media the new york times stated that  the primary target of the book a substantial work of analysis with almost 3,000 footnotes are statements made by environmental organizations like the worldwatch institute the world wildlife fund and greenpeace  the wall street journal deemed lomborg s work  a superbly documented and readable book  a washington post review claimed that  bj rn lomborg s good news about the environment is bad news for green ideologues his richly informative lucid book is now the place from which environmental policy decisions must be argued in fact the skeptical environmentalist is the most significant work on the environment since the appearance of its polar opposite rachel carson s silent spring in 1962 it s a magnificent achievement  rolling stone wrote that  lomborg pulls off the remarkable feat of welding the techno-optimism of the internet age with a lefty s concern for the fate of the planet 
in march 2003 the new york law school law review published an examination of the critical reviews of skeptical environmentalist from the scientific american nature and science magazines by professor of law david shoenbrod and then senior law student christi wilson of new york law school the authors take the perspective of a court faced with an argument against hearing an expert witness in order to evaluate whether lomborg was credible as an expert and whether his testimony is valid to his expertise they classify the types of criticisms leveled at lomborg and his arguments and proceed to evaluate each of the reasons given for disqualifying lomborg they conclude that a court should accept lomborg as a credible expert in the field of statistics and that his testimony was appropriately restricted to his area of expertise of course professor shoenbrod and wilson note mr lomborg s factual conclusions may not be correct nor his policy proposals effective but his criticisms should be addressed not merely dismissed out of hand
the union of concerned scientists and the danish committees on scientific dishonesty raised concern about the responses of certain sections of the scientific community to a peer reviewed book published under the category of environmental economics the groups worried that the receptions to lomborg were a politicization of science by scientists this unease was reflected in the involvement of the union of concerned scientists and danish committees on scientific dishonesty in  when scientists politicize science  making sense of controversy over the skeptical environmentalist  where roger a pielke argued 
in  green with ideology - the hidden agenda behind the  scientific  attacks on bj rn lomborg s controversial book the skeptical environmentalist  ronald bailey stated that  the bitter anti-lomborg campaign reveals the hidden crisis of what we might call ideological environmentalism  he further wrote 
accusations of scientific dishonesty
after the publication of the skeptical environmentalist lomborg was accused of scientific dishonesty several environmental scientists brought a total of three complaints against lomborg to the danish committees on scientific dishonesty  dcsd  a body under denmark s ministry of science technology and innovation lomborg was asked whether he regarded the book as a  debate  publication and thereby not under the purview of the dcsd or as a scientific work  he chose the latter clearing the way for the inquiry that followed the charges claimed that the skeptical environmentalist contained deliberately misleading data and flawed conclusions due to the similarity of the complaints the dcsd decided to proceed on the three cases under one investigation
dcsd investigation
on january 6 2003 a mixed dcsd ruling was released in which the committees decided that the skeptical environmentalist was scientifically dishonest but lomborg was innocent of wrongdoing due to a lack of expertise in the relevant fields 
the dcsd cited the skeptical environmentalist for 
msti review and response
on february 13 2003 lomborg filed a complaint against the dcsd s decision with the ministry of science technology and innovation  msti  which oversees the group
on december 17 2003 the ministry found that the dcsd had made a number of procedural errors including 
the ministry remitted the case to the dcsd in doing so the ministry indicated that it regarded the dcsd s previous findings of scientific dishonesty in regard to the book as invalid the ministry also instructed the dcsd to decide whether to reinvestigate on march 12 2004 the committee formally decided not to act further on the complaints reasoning that renewed scrutiny would in all likelihood result in the same conclusion
response of the scientific community
the original dcsd decision about lomborg provoked a petition among danish academics from 308 scientists many from the social sciences who criticised the dcsd s investigative methods
another group of danish scientists collected signatures in support of the dcsd the 640 signatures in this second petition came almost exclusively from the medical and natural sciences and included nobel laureate in chemistry jens christian skou former university rector kjeld m llg rd and professor poul harremo s from the technical university of denmark
continued debate and criticism
a group of scientists published an article in 2005 in the journal of information ethics in which they concluded that most criticism against lomborg was unjustified and that the scientific community had misused their authority to suppress the author
k re fog
the claim that allegations against lomborg were unsubstantiated was challenged in the next issue of journal of information ethics by k re fog one of the original dcsd petitioners fog reasserted his contention that despite the ministry s decision most of the accusations against lomborg were valid and rejected what he called  the galileo hypothesis  which portrays lomborg as a brave young man confronting an entrenched opposition
fog has established a curated catalogue of criticisms against lomborg which includes a section for each page of every skeptical environmentalist chapter fog enumerates and details what he believes to be flaws and errors in lomborg s work he explicitly indicates if particular mistakes may have been made deliberately by lomborg in order to mislead according to fog since none of his denunciations of lomborg s work have been proven false the suspicion that lomborg has misled deliberately is maintained lomborg has written a full text published online as godehetens pris  danish   that goes through the main allegations put forward by fog and others
