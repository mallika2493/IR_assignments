population pyramid - wikipedia
a population pyramid also called an age pyramid or age picture is a graphical illustration that shows the distribution of various age groups in a population  typically that of a country or region of the world  which forms the shape of a pyramid when the population is growing it is also used in ecology to determine the overall age distribution of a population  an indication of the reproductive capabilities and likelihood of the continuation of a species
it usually consists of two back-to-back histograms with the population plotted on the x-axis and age on the y-axis one showing the number of males and one showing females in a particular population in five-year age groups  also called cohorts  males are conventionally shown on the left and females on the right and they may be measured by raw number or as a percentage of the total population
population pyramids are often viewed as the most effective way to graphically depict the age and sex distribution of a population partly because of the very clear image these pyramids represent
a great deal of information about the population broken down by age and sex can be read from a population pyramid and this can shed light on the extent of development and other aspects of the population a population pyramid also tells how many people of each age range live in the area there tends to be more females than males in the older age groups due to females  longer life expectancy


types of population pyramid
while all countries  population pyramids differ four general types have been identified by the fertility and mortality rates of a country
in some countries the above  pyramids  are referred to by a description of their shape the classic example is the pyramid the stationary pyramid is referred to as a  clock-model   like the bell in a clock tower  the contracting pyramid is referred to as  onion  shaped or occasionally as  urn  shaped
youth bulge
the expansive case was described as youth bulge by gary fuller  1995  gunnar heinsohn  2003  argues that an excess in especially young adult male population predictably leads to social unrest war and terrorism as the  third and fourth sons  that find no prestigious positions in their existing societies rationalize their impetus to compete by religion or political ideology
heinsohn claims that most historical periods of social unrest lacking external triggers  such as rapid climatic changes or other catastrophic changes of the environment  and most genocides can be readily explained as a result of a built-up youth bulge including european colonialism 20th-century fascism rise of communism during the cold war and ongoing conflicts such as that in darfur and terrorism this factor has been also used to account for the arab spring events economic recessions such as the great depression of the 1930 s and the late 2000 s recession are also claimed to be explained in part due to a large youth population who cannot find jobs youth bulge can be seen as one factor among many in explaining social unrest and uprisings in society a 2016 study finds that youth bulges increase the chances of non-ethnic civil wars but not ethnic civil wars
youth bulge theory represents one of the most recently developed theories of war and social unrest and has become highly influential on us foreign policy as two major us proponents of the theory political scientists jack goldstone and gary fuller have acted as consultants to the us government
a large population of adolescents entering the labor force and electorate strains at the seams of the economy and polity which were designed for smaller populations this creates unemployment and alienation unless new opportunities are created quickly enough   in which case a  demographic dividend  accrues because productive workers outweigh young and elderly dependents yet the 16 30 age range is associated with risk-taking especially among males in general youth bulges in developing countries are associated with higher unemployment and as a result a heightened risk of violence and political instability for cincotta and doces  2011  the transition to more mature age structures is almost a sine qua non for democratization
many countries with the largest youth bulge are african nations severely afflicted by the hiv aids epidemic which has decreased overall lifespan dramatically as of 2012 the largest youth bulge is found in zimbabwe which has a population structure with 56.57  between the ages of 15 and 29
the middle east and north africa
the middle east and north africa are currently experiencing a prominent youth bulge structural changes in service provision especially health care beginning in the 1960 s created the conditions for a demographic explosion which has resulted in a population consisting primarily of younger people it is estimated that around 65  of the regional population is under the age of 30
the middle east has invested more in education including religious education than most other regions such that education is available to most children however that education has not led to higher levels of employment and youth unemployment is currently at 25  the highest of any single region of this 25  over half are first time entrants into the job market
the youth bulge in the middle east and north africa has been favorably compared to that of east asia which harnessed this human capital and saw huge economic growth in recent decades the youth bulge has been referred to by the middle east youth initiative as a demographic gift which if engaged could fuel regional economic growth and development
the population of egypt was increased from 30,083,419 persons in 1966 to roughly 79,000,000 persons by 2008 the most of egyptians live in the thin green spaces near the banks of the nile river in an area of about 40,000 square kilometers  15,000 sq mi  where the only arable land is found and competing with the need of human habitations in late 2010 around 40 percent of egypt s population of just under 80 million lived on the fiscal income equivalent of roughly us 2 daily with a large part of the population relying on subsidized goods
according to the peterson institute for international economics and other proponents of demographic structural approach  cliodynamics  the basic problem egypt has is unemployment driven by a demographic youth bulge  with the number of new people entering the job force at about 4  a year unemployment in egypt is almost 10 times as high for college graduates as it is for people who have gone through elementary school particularly educated urban youth who are precisely those people that were seen out in the streets during 2011 egyptian revolution
this is in stark contrast to others like kuwait and saudi arabia who are actively trying to engage and utilize their youth bulge or algeria and morocco which have tried to mitigate the worst effects of a disenfranchised and disillusioned youth
uses of population pyramids
population pyramids can be used to find the number of economic dependents being supported in a particular population economic dependents are defined as those under 15  children who are in full-time education and therefore unable to work  and those over 65  those who have the option of being retired  in some less developed countries children start work well younger than the age of 15 and in some developed countries it is common to not begin work until age 30  just like in the north european countries  and people may work older than the age of 65 or retire early therefore the definition provides an approximation in many countries the government plans the economy in such a way that the working population can support these dependents this number can be further used to calculate the dependency ratio in that population
population pyramids can be used to observe the  natural  increase decrease birth and death rate
