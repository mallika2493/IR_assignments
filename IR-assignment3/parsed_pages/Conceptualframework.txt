conceptual framework - wikipedia
a conceptual framework is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts it is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply isaiah berlin used the metaphor of a  fox  and a  hedgehog  to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world  such as dante alighieri blaise pascal fyodor dostoyevsky plato henrik ibsen and georg wilhelm friedrich hegel  foxes on the other hand incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple sometimes conflicting lenses  examples include johann wolfgang von goethe james joyce william shakespeare aristotle herodotus moli re honor  de balzac 
economists use the conceptual framework of  supply  and  demand  to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers like many conceptual frameworks supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations  see demand curve 


overview
the use of the term conceptual framework crosses both scale  large and small theories  and contexts  social science marketing applied science art etc  its explicit definition and application can therefore vary
conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research one set of scholars has applied the notion of conceptual framework to deductive empirical research at the micro- or individual study level they employ american football plays as a useful metaphor to clarify the meaning of conceptual framework  used in the context of a deductive empirical study 
likewise conceptual frameworks are abstract representations connected to the research project s goal that direct the collection and analysis of data  on the plane of observation   the ground  critically a football play is a  plan of action  tied to a particular timely purpose usually summarized as long or short yardage shields and rangarajan argue that it is this tie to  purpose  that make american football plays such a good metaphor they define a conceptual framework as  the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project s purpose  like football plays conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose explanation is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research the formal hypothesis is the framework associated with explanation explanatory research usually focuses on  why  or  what caused  a phenomenon to occur formal hypotheses posit possible explanations  answers to the why question  that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence  usually quantitative using statistical tests  for example kai huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in us cities three factors were posited to influence residential fires these factors  environment population and building characteristics  became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose   explain factors that influenced home fires in us cities
types
several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified and line up with a research purpose in the following ways 
note that shields and rangarajan  2013  do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing nor do they claim the system is applicable to inductive forms of empirical research rather the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own research design
frameworks have also been used to explain conflict theory and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution within these conflict frameworks visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance boundaries form and within these boundaries tensions regarding laws and chaos  or freedom  are mitigated these frameworks often function like cells with sub-frameworks stasis evolution and revolution anomalies may exist without adequate  lenses  or  filters  to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them
