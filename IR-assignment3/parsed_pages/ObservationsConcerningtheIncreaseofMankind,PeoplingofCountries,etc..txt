the essay examines population growth and its limits writing as at the time a loyal subject of the british empire franklin argues that the british should increase their population and power by expanding across the americas taking the view that europe is too crowded


content
franklin projected an exponential growth  doubling every twenty five years  in the population of the british colonies that in a century  the greatest number of englishmen will be on this side of the water  thereby increasing the power of england as englishmen they would share language manners and religion with their countrymen in england thus extending english civilization and english rule substantially
franklin viewed the land in america as underutilized and available for the expansion of farming this enabled the population to establish households at an earlier age and support larger families than was possible in europe the limit to expansion reached in europe but not america is reached when the  crowding and interfering with each other s means of subsistence  an idea that would inspire malthus
protectionist policies in 1750 led to the prohibition of ironworks in america franklin s essay argued against such policies by advancing the position that labor is more valued in self-owned farming given the availability of land in america  no man continues long a laborer for others but gets a plantation of his own  growth in the colonies should increase demand for british manufacturing making protectionism unwise an argument appreciated by adam smith
franklin argued that slavery diminished the nation undermined the virtue of industry and diminished the health and vitality of the nation he argued that slavery wasn t as cost effective or productive as free labor
influence
the work was cited by adam smith david hume samuel johnson richard price and william godwin it influenced thomas malthus in an essay on the principle of population and through malthus charles darwin
science historian conway zirkle has described the work as an influence on natural selection zirkle has noted that  franklin is really the source of darwin s inspiration for he gave malthus the clue to the theory of population we now call malthusian and malthus gave darwin the clue which led to the discovery of natural selection 
controversial paragraphs
while the essay was an important contribution to economics and population growth recent attention has focused on the final two paragraphs
franklin was alarmed by the influx of german immigrants to pennsylvania the german immigrants were lacking in a liberal political tradition the english language and english culture franklin wrote  why should the palatine boors be suffered to swarm into our settlements and by herding together establish their languages and manners to the exclusion of ours  why should pennsylvania founded by the english become a colony of aliens who will shortly be so numerous as to germanize us instead of our anglifying them and will never adopt our language or customs any more than they can acquire our complexion  
recognizing the potential offense that these comments might give franklin deleted the final paragraph from later editions of the essay but his derogatory remarks about the german and dutch were picked up and used against him by his political enemies in philadelphia leading to a decline in support among the pennsylvania dutch partly as a result he was defeated in the october 1764 election to the pennsylvania provincial assembly franklin funded education and charitable institutions to settle and assimilate german immigrants and would in time regain their good will
franklin favored immigration of anglo-saxons a view condemned as racist in recent literature he writes in paragraph 24 
gordon s wood and others note that franklin viewed this kind of bias as universal he ends this section with  but perhaps i am partial to the complexion of my country for such kind of partiality is natural to mankind
