earth's energy budget - wikipedia
earth s energy budget is an accounting of how much energy enters the earth s climate system from the sun how much energy is lost to space and accounts for the remainder as stored on the earth and its atmosphere quantifying changes in these amounts is required to accurately model the earth s climate
received radiation is unevenly distributed over the planet because the sun heats equatorial regions more than polar regions energy is absorbed by the atmosphere hydrosphere and lithosphere and in a process informally described as earth s heat engine the solar heating is redistributed through evaporation of surface water convection rainfall winds and ocean circulation when the incoming solar energy is balanced by an equal flow of heat to space the earth is said to be in radiative equilibrium and under that condition global temperatures will be stable
disturbances of earth s radiative equilibrium such as an increase of greenhouse gases will change global temperatures in response however earth s energy balance and heat fluxes depend on many factors such as atmospheric composition  mainly aerosols and greenhouse gases  the albedo  reflectivity  of surface properties cloud cover and vegetation and land use patterns changes in surface temperature due to earth s energy budget do not occur instantaneously due to the inertia of the oceans and the cryosphere the net heat flux is buffered primarily by becoming part of the ocean s heat content until a new equilibrium state is established between radiative forcings and the climate response


energy budget
in spite of the enormous transfers of energy into and from the earth it maintains a constant temperature because as a whole there is no net gain or loss  earth receives the same amount of energy via insolation  all forms of electromagnetic radiation  as it emits via atmospheric and terrestrial radiation  shifted to longer electromagnetic wavelengths  to space
to quantify earth s heat budget or heat balance let the insolation received at the top of the atmosphere be 100 units as shown in the accompanying illustration called the albedo of earth around 35 units are reflected back to space  27 from the top of clouds 2 from snow and ice-covered areas and 6 by other parts of the atmosphere the 65 remaining units are absorbed  14 within the atmosphere and 51 by the earth s surface these 51 units are radiated to space in the form of terrestrial radiation  17 directly radiated to space and 34 absorbed by the atmosphere  19 through latent heat of condensation 9 via convection and turbulence and 6 directly absorbed  the 48 units absorbed by the atmosphere  34 units from terrestrial radiation and 14 from insolation  are finally radiated back to space these 65 units  17 from the ground and 48 from the atmosphere  balance the 65 units absorbed from the sun  thereby demonstrating no net gain of energy by the earth
incoming radiant energy  shortwave 
the total amount of energy received per second at the top of earth s atmosphere  toa  is measured in watts and is given by the solar constant times the cross-sectional area of the earth because the surface area of a sphere is four times the cross-sectional surface area of a sphere  ie the area of a circle  the average toa flux is one quarter of the solar constant and so is approximately 340 w m  since the absorption varies with location as well as with diurnal seasonal and annual variations the numbers quoted are long-term averages typically averaged from multiple satellite measurements
of the  340 w m  of solar radiation received by the earth an average of  77 w m  is reflected back to space by clouds and the atmosphere and  23 w m  is reflected by the surface albedo leaving  240 w m  of solar energy input to the earth s energy budget this gives the earth a mean net albedo of 0.29
earth s internal heat and other small effects
the geothermal heat flux from the earth s interior is estimated to be 47 terawatts this comes to 0.087 watt square metre which represents only 0.027  of earth s total energy budget at the surface which is dominated by 173,000 terawatts of incoming solar radiation
other minor sources of energy are usually ignored in these calculations including accretion of interplanetary dust and solar wind light from distant stars and the thermal radiation from space earlier joseph fourier had claimed that deep space radiation was significant in a paper often cited as the first on the greenhouse effect
longwave radiation
longwave radiation is usually defined as outgoing infrared energy leaving the planet however the atmosphere absorbs parts initially or cloud cover can reflect radiation generally heat energy is transported between the planet s surface layers  land and ocean  to the atmosphere transported via evapotranspiration and latent heat fluxes or conduction convection processes ultimately energy is radiated in the form of longwave infrared radiation back into space
recent satellite observations indicate additional precipitation which is sustained by increased energy leaving the surface through evaporation  the latent heat flux  offsetting increases in longwave flux to the surface
earth s energy imbalance
if the incoming energy flux is not equal to the outgoing energy flux the result is an energy imbalance that amounts to net heat added to or lost by the planet  if the incoming flux is larger or smaller than the outgoing respectively  earth s energy imbalance measurements provided by argo floats have detected an accumulation of ocean heat content  ohc  the estimated imbalance was measured during a deep solar minimum of 2005-2010 to be 0.58   0.15 w m  later research estimated the surface energy imbalance to be 0.60   0.17 w m 
measurement
several satellites indirectly measure the energy absorbed and radiated by earth and by inference the energy imbalance the nasa earth radiation budget experiment  erbe  project involves three such satellites  the earth radiation budget satellite  erbs  launched october 1984  noaa-9 launched december 1984  and noaa-10 launched september 1986
today nasa s satellite instruments provided by ceres part of the nasa s earth observing system  eos  are designed to measure both solar-reflected and earth-emitted radiation
natural greenhouse effect
the major atmospheric gases  oxygen and nitrogen  are transparent to incoming sunlight but are also transparent to outgoing thermal  infrared  radiation however water vapor carbon dioxide methane and other trace gases are opaque to many wavelengths of thermal radiation the earth s surface radiates the net equivalent of 17 percent of the incoming solar energy in the form of thermal infrared however the amount that directly escapes to space is only about 12 percent of incoming solar energy the remaining fraction 5 to 6 percent is absorbed by the atmosphere by greenhouse gas molecules
when greenhouse gas molecules absorb thermal infrared energy their temperature rises those gases then radiate an increased amount of thermal infrared energy in all directions heat radiated upward continues to encounter greenhouse gas molecules  those molecules also absorb the heat and their temperature rises and the amount of heat they radiate increases the atmosphere thins with altitude and at roughly 5 6 kilometres the concentration of greenhouse gases in the overlying atmosphere is so thin that heat can escape to space
because greenhouse gas molecules radiate infrared energy in all directions some of it spreads downward and ultimately returns to the earth s surface where it is absorbed the earth s surface temperature is thus higher than it would be if it were heated only by direct solar heating this supplemental heating is the natural greenhouse effect it is as if the earth is covered by a blanket that allows high frequency radiation  sunlight  to enter but slows the rate at which the low frequency infrared radiant energy emitted by the earth leaves
climate sensitivity
a change in the incident radiated portion of the energy budget is referred to as a radiative forcing
climate sensitivity is the steady state change in the equilibrium temperature as a result of changes in the energy budget
climate forcings and global warming
climate forcings are changes that cause temperatures to rise or fall disrupting the energy balance natural climate forcings include changes in the sun s brightness milankovitch cycles  small variations in the shape of earth s orbit and its axis of rotation that occur over thousands of years  and volcanic eruptions that inject light-reflecting particles as high as the stratosphere man-made forcings include particle pollution  aerosols  that absorb and reflect incoming sunlight  deforestation which changes how the surface reflects and absorbs sunlight  and the rising concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which decreases the rate at which heat is radiated to space
a forcing can trigger feedbacks that intensify  positive feedback  or weaken  negative feedback  the original forcing for example loss of ice at the poles which makes them less reflective causes greater absorption of energy and so increases the rate at which the ice melts is an example of a positive feedback
the observed planetary energy imbalance during the recent solar minimum shows that solar forcing of climate although natural and significant is overwhelmed by anthropogenic climate forcing
in 2012 nasa scientists reported that to stop global warming atmospheric co2 content would have to be reduced to 350 ppm or less assuming all other climate forcings were fixed the impact of anthropogenic aerosols has not been quantified but individual aerosol types are thought to have substantial heating and cooling effects
