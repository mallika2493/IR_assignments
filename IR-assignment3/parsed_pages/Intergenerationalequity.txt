economics usage
history
since the first recorded debt issuance in sumaria in 1796 bc one of the penalties for failure to repay a loan has been debt bondage in some instances this repayment of financial debt with labor included the debtor s children essentially condemning the debtor family to perpetual slavery about one millennium after written debt contracts were created the concept of debt forgiveness appears in the old testament called jubilee  leviticus 25  and in greek law when solon introduces seisachtheia both of these historical examples of debt forgiveness involved freeing children from slavery caused by their parents  debt
while slavery is illegal in all countries today north korea has a policy called  three generations of punishment  which has been documented by shin dong-hyuk and used as a moral paragon of punishing children for parents  mistakes stanley druckenmiller and geoffrey canada have applied this concept  calling it  generational theft   to the large increase in government debt being left by the baby boomers to their children
investment management
in the context of institutional investment management intergenerational equity is the principle that an endowed institution s spending rate must not exceed its after-inflation rate of compound return so that investment gains are spent equally on current and future constituents of the endowed assets this concept was originally set out in 1974 by economist james tobin who wrote that  the trustees of endowed institutions are the guardians of the future against the claims of the present their task in managing the endowment is to preserve equity among generations  in terms of an economical context intergenerational equity refers to relationship that a particular family has on resources an example is the forest-dwelling civilians in papua new guinea who for generations have lived in a certain part of the forest and thus becomes their land the adult population sell the trees for palm oil to make money if they cannot make a sustainable development on managing their resources their next or future generations will lose this resources
us national debt
one debate about the national debt relates to intergenerational equity for example if one generation is receiving the benefit of government programs or employment enabled by deficit spending and debt accumulation to what extent does the resulting higher debt impose risks and costs on future generations  there are several factors to consider 
economist paul krugman wrote in march 2013 that by neglecting public investment and failing to create jobs we are doing far more harm to future generations than merely passing along debt   fiscal policy is indeed a moral issue and we should be ashamed of what we re doing to the next generation s economic prospects but our sin involves investing too little not borrowing too much  young workers face high unemployment and studies have shown their income may lag throughout their careers as a result teacher jobs have been cut which could affect the quality of education and competitiveness of younger americans
australian politician christine milne made similar statements in the lead up to the 2014 carbon price repeal bill naming the liberal national party  elected to parliament in 2013  and inherently its ministers as intergenerational thieves  her statement was based on the party s attempts to roll back progressive carbon tax policy and the impact this would have on the intergenerational equity of future generations
