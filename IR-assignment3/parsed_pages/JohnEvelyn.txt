works
evelyn s diary remained unpublished as a manuscript until 1818 it is in a quarto volume containing 700 pages covering the years between 1641 and 1697 and is continued in a smaller book   which brings the narrative down to within three weeks of its author s death a selection from this was edited by william bray with the permission of the evelyn family in 1818 under the title of memoirs illustrative of the life and writings of john evelyn comprising his diary from 1641 to 1705 6 and a selection of his familiar letters other editions followed the most notable being those of h b wheatley  1879  and austin dobson  3 vols 1906 
evelyn s active mind produced many other works and although these have been overshadowed by the famous diary they are of considerable interest they include 
some of these were reprinted in the miscellaneous writings of john evelyn edited  1825  by william upcott
evelyn s friendship with margaret blagge afterwards mrs godolphin is recorded in the diary when he says he designed  to consecrate her worthy life to posterity  this he effectually did in a little masterpiece of religious biography which remained in manuscript in the possession of the harcourt family until it was edited by samuel wilberforce bishop of oxford as the life of mrs godolphin  1847  reprinted in the  king s classics   1904  the picture of mistress blagge s saintly life at court is heightened in interest when read in connexion with the scandalous memoirs of the comte de gramont or contemporary political satires on the court
