world energy resources - wikipedia
the worlds energy resources can be divided into fossil fuel nuclear fuel and renewable resources the estimates for the amount of energy in these resources is given in zettajoules  zj  which is 1021 joules
the 2c target in global warming means only a quarter of existing exploitable fossil fuel reserves are burnable


fossil fuel
remaining reserves of fossil fuel are estimated as 
these are the proven energy reserves  real reserves may be up to a factor 4 larger significant uncertainty exists for these numbers estimating the remaining fossil fuels on the planet depends on a detailed understanding of the earth s crust while modern drilling technology makes it possible to drill wells in up to 3 km of water to verify the exact composition of the geology one half of the ocean is deeper than 3 km leaving about a third of the planet beyond the reach of detailed analysis
in addition to uncertainty in real reserves there is significant uncertainty in technological and economical factors that impact what percentage of reserves can be recovered gainfully in general the easiest to reach deposits are the first extracted factors affecting the cost of exploiting the remaining reserves include the accessibility of fossil deposits the level of sulfur and other pollutants in the oil and the coal transportation costs and societal instability in producing regions
coal
coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel this was the fuel that launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow in use  china which already has many of the world s most polluted cities was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power plants every week coal is the fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy demand of the global community short of global warming concerns and other pollutants according to the international energy agency the proven reserves of coal are around 909 billion tonnes which could sustain the current production rate for 155 years although at a 5  growth per annum this would be reduced to 45 years or until 2051 with the fischer- tropsch process it is possible to make liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel from coal in the united states 49  of electricity generation comes from burning coal
oil
it is estimated that there may be 57 zj of oil reserves on earth  although estimates vary from a low of 8 zj consisting of currently proven and recoverable reserves to a maximum of 110 zj  consisting of available but not necessarily recoverable reserves and including optimistic estimates for unconventional sources such as tar sands and oil shale current consensus among the 18 recognized estimates of supply profiles is that the peak of extraction will occur in 2020 at the rate of 93-million barrels per day  mbd  current oil consumption is at the rate of 0.18 zj per year  31.1 billion barrels  or 85-mbd
there is growing concern that peak oil production may be reached in the near future resulting in severe oil price increases a 2005 french economics industry and finance ministry report suggested a worst-case scenario that could occur as early as 2013 there are also theories that peak of the global oil production may occur in as little as 2 3 years the aspo predicts peak year to be in 2010 some other theories present the view that it has already taken place in 2005 world crude oil production  including lease condensates  according to us eia data decreased from a peak of 73.720 mbd in 2005 to 73.437 in 2006 72.981 in 2007 and 73.697 in 2008 according to peak oil theory increasing production will lead to a more rapid collapse of production in the future while decreasing production will lead to a slower decrease as the bell-shaped curve will be spread out over more years
in a stated goal of increasing oil prices to  75 barrel which had fallen from a high of  147 to a low of  40 opec announced decreasing production by 2.2 mbd beginning 1 january 2009
sustainability
political considerations over the security of supplies environmental concerns related to global warming and sustainability are expected to move the world s energy consumption away from fossil fuels the concept of peak oil shows that about half of the available petroleum resources have been produced and predicts a decrease of production
a government move away from fossil fuels would most likely create economic pressure through carbon emissions and green taxation some countries are taking action as a result of the kyoto protocol and further steps in this direction are proposed for example the european commission has proposed that the energy policy of the european union should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the eu s overall mix from less than 7  in 2007 to 20  by 2020
the antithesis of sustainability is a disregard for limits commonly referred to as the easter island effect which is the concept of being unable to develop sustainability resulting in the depletion of natural resources some estimate assuming current consumption rates current oil reserves could be completely depleted by the year 2050
nuclear fuel
nuclear energy
the international atomic energy agency estimates the remaining uranium resources to be equal to 2500 zj this assumes the use of breeder reactors which are able to create more fissile material than they consume ipcc estimated currently proved economically recoverable uranium deposits for once-through fuel cycles reactors to be only 2 zj the ultimately recoverable uranium is estimated to be 17 zj for once-through reactors and 1000 zj with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors
resources and technology do not constrain the capacity of nuclear power to contribute to meeting the energy demand for the 21st century however political and environmental concerns about nuclear safety and radioactive waste started to limit the growth of this energy supply at the end of last century particularly due to a number of nuclear accidents concerns about nuclear proliferation  especially with plutonium produced by breeder reactors  mean that the development of nuclear power by countries such as iran and syria is being actively discouraged by the international community
although at the beginning of the 21st century uranium is the primary nuclear fuel worldwide others such as thorium and hydrogen had been under investigation since the middle of the 20th century
thorium reserves significantly exceed those of uranium and of course hydrogen is abundant it is also considered by many to be easier to obtain than uranium while uranium mines are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners thorium is taken from open pits and is estimated to be roughly three times as abundant as uranium in the earth s crust
since the 1960s numerous facilities throughout the world have burned thorium
nuclear fusion
alternatives for energy production through fusion of hydrogen has been under investigation since the 1950s no materials can withstand the temperatures required to ignite the fuel so it must be confined by methods which use no materials magnetic and inertial confinement are the main alternatives  cadarache inertial confinement fusion  both of which are hot research topics in the early years of the 21st century
fusion power is the process driving the sun and other stars it generates large quantities of heat by fusing the nuclei of hydrogen or helium isotopes which may be derived from seawater the heat can theoretically be harnessed to generate electricity the temperatures and pressures needed to sustain fusion make it a very difficult process to control fusion is theoretically able to supply vast quantities of energy with relatively little pollution although both the united states and the european union along with other countries are supporting fusion research  such as investing in the iter facility  according to one report inadequate research has stalled progress in fusion research for the past 20 years
renewable resources
renewable resources are available each year unlike non-renewable resources which are eventually depleted a simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest while the forest could be depleted if it is managed it represents a continuous supply of energy vs the coal mine which once has been exhausted is gone most of earth s available energy resources are renewable resources renewable resources account for more than 93 percent of total us energy reserves annual renewable resources were multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources in other words if all non-renewable resources were uniformly exhausted in 30 years they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year if all available renewable resources were developed
solar energy
renewable energy sources are even larger than the traditional fossil fuels and in theory can easily supply the world s energy needs 89 pw of solar power falls on the planet s surface while it is not possible to capture all or even most of this energy capturing less than 0.02  would be enough to meet the current energy needs barriers to further solar generation include the high price of making solar cells and reliance on weather patterns to generate electricity also current solar generation does not produce electricity at night which is a particular problem in high northern and southern latitude countries  energy demand is highest in winter while availability of solar energy is lowest this could be overcome by buying power from countries closer to the equator during winter months and may also be addressed with technological developments such as the development of inexpensive energy storage globally solar generation is the fastest growing source of energy seeing an annual average growth of 35  over the past few years japan europe china us and india are the major growing investors in solar energy solar power s share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1 
wind power
the available wind energy estimates range from 300 tw to 870 tw using the lower estimate just 5  of the available wind energy would supply the current worldwide energy needs most of this wind energy is available over the open ocean the oceans cover 71  of the planet and wind tends to blow more strongly over open water because there are fewer obstructions
wave and tidal power
at the end of 2005 0.3 gw of electricity was produced by tidal power due to the tidal forces created by the moon  68   and the sun  32   and the earth s relative rotation with respect to moon and sun there are fluctuating tides these tidal fluctuations result in dissipation at an average rate of about 3.7 tw
another physical limitation is the energy available in the tidal fluctuations of the oceans which is about 0.6 ej  exajoule  note this is only a tiny fraction of the total rotational energy of the earth without forcing this energy would be dissipated  at a dissipation rate of 3.7 tw  in about four semi-diurnal tide periods so dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans therefore this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 tw  20  of the dissipation rate  in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much
waves are derived from wind which is in turn derived from solar energy and at each conversion there is a drop of about two orders of magnitude in available energy the total power of waves that wash against our shores add up to 3 tw
geothermal
estimates of exploitable worldwide geothermal energy resources vary considerably depending on assumed investments in technology and exploration and guesses about geological formations according to a 1999 study it was thought that this might amount to between 65 and 138 gw of electrical generation capacity  using enhanced technology  other estimates range from 35 to 2000 gw of electrical generation capacity with a further potential for 140 ej year of direct use
a 2006 report by mit that took into account the use of enhanced geothermal systems  egs  concluded that it would be affordable to generate 100 gwe  gigawatts of electricity  or more by 2050 just in the united states for a maximum investment of 1 billion us dollars in research and development over 15 years the mit report calculated the world s total egs resources to be over 13 yj of which over 200 zj would be extractable with the potential to increase this to over 2 yj with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world s energy needs for several millennia the total heat content of the earth is 13,000,000 yj
biomass
production of biomass and biofuels are growing industries as interest in sustainable fuel sources is growing utilizing waste products avoids a food vs fuel trade-off and burning methane gas reduces greenhouse gas emissions because even though it releases carbon dioxide carbon dioxide is 23 times less of a greenhouse gas than is methane biofuels represent a sustainable partial replacement for fossil fuels but their net impact on greenhouse gas emissions depends on the agricultural practices used to grow the plants used as feedstock to create the fuels while it is widely believed that biofuels can be carbon-neutral there is evidence that biofuels produced by current farming methods are substantial net carbon emitters geothermal and biomass are the only two renewable energy sources that require careful management to avoid local depletion
hydropower
in 2005 hydroelectric power supplied 16.4  of world electricity down from 21.0  in 1973 but only 2.2  of the world s energy
