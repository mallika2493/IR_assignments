wake - wikipedia
in fluid dynamics a wake may either be 


wake effects caused by viscosity
the wake is the region of disturbed flow  often turbulent  downstream of a solid body moving through a fluid caused by the flow of the fluid around the body
for a blunt body in subsonic external flow for example the apollo or orion capsules during descent and landing the wake is massively separated and behind the body is a reverse flow region where the flow is moving toward the body this phenomenon is often observed in wind tunnel testing of aircraft and is especially important when parachute systems are involved because unless the parachute lines extend the canopy beyond the reverse flow region the chute can fail to inflate and thus collapse parachutes deployed into wakes suffer dynamic pressure deficits which reduce their expected drag forces high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations are often undertaken to model wake flows although such modeling has uncertainties associated with turbulence modeling  for example rans versus les implementations  in addition to unsteady flow effects example applications include rocket stage separation and aircraft store separation
waves by density differences like a water surface
in incompressible fluids  liquids  such as water a bow wake is created when a watercraft moves through the medium  as the medium cannot be compressed it must be displaced instead resulting in a wave as with all wave forms it spreads outward from the source until its energy is overcome or lost usually by friction or dispersion
the non-dimensional parameter of interest is the froude number
kelvin wake pattern
waterfowl and boats moving across the surface of water produce a wake pattern first explained mathematically by lord kelvin and known today as the kelvin wake pattern
this pattern consists of two wake lines that form the arms of a chevron v with the source of the wake at the vertex of the v for sufficiently slow motion each wake line is offset from the path of the wake source by around arcsin 1 3    19.47  and is made up of feathery wavelets angled at roughly 53  to the path
the inside of the v  of total opening 39  as indicated above  is filled with transverse curved waves each of which is an arc of a circle centered at a point lying on the path at a distance twice that of the arc to the wake source this pattern is independent of the speed and size of the wake source over a significant range of values
however the pattern changes at high speeds  only  viz above a hull froude number of approximately 0.5 then as the source s speed increases the transverse waves diminish and the points of maximum amplitude on the wavelets form a second v within the wake pattern which grows narrower with the increased speed of the source
the angles in this pattern are not intrinsic properties of merely water  any isentropic and incompressible liquid with low viscosity will exhibit the same phenomenon furthermore this phenomenon has nothing to do with turbulence everything discussed here is based on the linear theory of an ideal fluid cf airy wave theory
parts of the pattern may be obscured by the effects of propeller wash and tail eddies behind the boat s stern and by the boat being a large object and not a point source the water need not be stationary but may be moving as in a large river and the important consideration then is the velocity of the water relative to a boat or other object causing a wake
this pattern follows from the dispersion relation of deep water waves which is often written as
where
 deep  means that the depth is greater than half of the wavelength this formula implies that the group velocity of a deep water wave is half of its phase velocity which in turn goes as the square root of the wavelength two velocity parameters of importance for the wake pattern are 
as the surface object moves it continuously generates small disturbances which are the sum of sinusoidal waves with a wide spectrum of wavelengths those waves with the longest wavelengths have phase speeds above v and dissipate into the surrounding water and are not easily observed other waves with phase speeds at or below v however are amplified through constructive interference and form visible shock waves stationary in position wrt the boat
the angle   between the phase shock wave front and the path of the object is     arcsin c v  if c v   1 or    1 no later waves can catch up with earlier waves and no shockwave forms
in deep water shock waves form even from slow-moving sources because waves with short enough wavelengths move slower these shock waves are at sharper angles than one would naively expect because it is group velocity that dictates the area of constructive interference and in deep water the group velocity is half of the phase velocity
all shock waves that each by itself would have had an angle between 33  and 72  are compressed into a narrow band of wake with angles between 15  and 19  with the strongest constructive interference at the outer edge  angle arcsin 1 3    19.47   placing the two arms of the v in the celebrated kelvin wake pattern
a concise geometric construction demonstrates that strikingly this group shock angle wrt the path of the boat 19.47  for any and all of the above   is actually independent of v c and g  it merely relies on the fact that the group velocity is half of the phase velocity c on any planet slow-swimming objects have  effective mach number  3 
the wavefronts of the wavelets in the wake are at 53  which is roughly the average of 33  and 72  the wave components with would-be shock wave angles between 73  and 90  dominate the interior of the v they end up half-way between the point of generation and the current location of the wake source this explains the curvature of the arcs
those very short waves with would-be shock wave angles below 33  lack a mechanism to reinforce their amplitudes through constructive interference and are usually seen as small ripples on top of the interior transverse waves

other effects
the above describes an ideal wake where the body s means of propulsion has no other effect on the water in practice the wave pattern between the v-shaped wavefronts is usually mixed with the effects of propeller backwash and eddying behind the boat s  usually square-ended  stern
recreation
 no wake zones  may prohibit wakes in marinas near moorings and within some distance of shore in order to facilitate recreation by other boats and reduce the damage wakes cause powered narrowboats on british canals are not permitted to create a breaking wash  a wake large enough to create a breaking wave  along the banks as this erodes them this rule normally restricts these vessels to 4 statute miles per hour or less
wakes are occasionally used recreationally swimmers people riding personal watercraft and aquatic mammals such as dolphins can ride the leading edge of a wake in the sport of wakeboarding the wake is used as a jump the wake is also used to propel a surfer in the sport of wakesurfing in the sport of water polo the ball carrier can swim while advancing the ball propelled ahead with the wake created by alternating armstrokes in crawl stroke a technique known as dribbling
