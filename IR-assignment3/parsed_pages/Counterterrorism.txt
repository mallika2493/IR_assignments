counter-terrorism - wikipedia
counter-terrorism  also spelled counterterrorism   also called anti-terrorism  incorporates the practice military tactics techniques and strategy that government military law enforcement business and intelligence agencies use to combat or prevent terrorism counter-terrorism strategies include attempts to counter financing of terrorism
if terrorism is part of a broader insurgency counter-terrorism may employ counter-insurgency measures the united states armed forces use the term foreign internal defense for programs that support other countries in attempts to suppress insurgency lawlessness or subversion or to reduce the conditions under which these threats to security may develop


history
in response to the escalating terror campaign in britain carried out by the militant irish fenians in the 1880s the home secretary sir william harcourt established the first counter-terrorism unit ever the special irish branch was initially formed as a section of the criminal investigation department of the london metropolitan police in 1883 to combat irish republican terrorism through infiltration and subversion
harcourt envisioned a permanent unit dedicated to the prevention of politically motivated violence through the use of modern techniques such as undercover infiltration this pioneering branch was the first to be trained in counter-terrorism techniques
its name was changed to special branch as it had its remit gradually expanded to incorporate a general role in counterterrorism combating foreign subversion and infiltrating organized crime law enforcement agencies in britain and elsewhere established similar units
counterterrorism forces expanded with the perceived growing threat of terrorism in the late 20th century specifically after the september 11 attacks western governments made counter-terrorism efforts a priority including more foreign cooperation shifting tactics involving red teams  and preventive measures
planning
most counter-terrorism strategies involve an increase in standard police and domestic intelligence the central activities are traditional  interception of communications and the tracing of persons new technology has however expanded the range of military and law enforcement operations
domestic intelligence is often directed at specific groups defined on the basis of origin or religion which is a source of political controversy mass surveillance of an entire population raises objections on civil liberties grounds homegrown terrorists especially lone wolves are often harder to detect because of their citizenship or legal alien status and ability to stay under the radar
to select the effective action when terrorism appears to be more of an isolated event the appropriate government organizations need to understand the source motivation methods of preparation and tactics of terrorist groups good intelligence is at the heart of such preparation as well as political and social understanding of any grievances that might be solved ideally one gets information from inside the group a very difficult challenge for humint because operational terrorist cells are often small with all members known to one another perhaps even related
counterintelligence is a great challenge with the security of cell-based systems since the ideal but nearly impossible goal is to obtain a clandestine source within the cell financial tracking can play a role as can communications intercept but both of these approaches need to be balanced against legitimate expectations of privacy
legal contexts
in response to the growing legislation
since 1978 the uk s terrorism laws have been regularly reviewed by a security-cleared independent reviewer of terrorism legislation whose reports are submitted to parliament and published in full
human rights
one of the primary difficulties of implementing effective counter-terrorist measures is the waning of civil liberties and individual privacy that such measures often entail both for citizens of and for those detained by states attempting to combat terror at times measures designed to tighten security have been seen as abuses of power or even violations of human rights
examples of these problems can include prolonged incommunicado detention without judicial review  risk of subjecting to torture during the transfer return and extradition of people between or within countries  and the adoption of security measures that restrain the rights or freedoms of citizens and breach principles of non-discrimination examples include 
many would argue that such violations could exacerbate rather than counter the terrorist threat human rights advocates argue for the crucial role of human rights protection as an intrinsic part to fight against terrorism this suggests as proponents of human security have long argued that respecting human rights may indeed help us to incur security amnesty international included a section on confronting terrorism in the recommendations in the madrid agenda arising from the madrid summit on democracy and terrorism  madrid march 8 11 2005  
while international efforts to combat terrorism have focused on the need to enhance cooperation between states proponents of human rights  as well as human security  have suggested that more effort needs to be given to the effective inclusion of human rights protection as a crucial element in that cooperation they argue that international human rights obligations do not stop at borders and a failure to respect human rights in one state may undermine its effectiveness in the international effort to cooperate to combat terrorism
preemptive neutralization
some countries see preemptive attacks as a legitimate strategy this includes capturing killing or disabling suspected terrorists before they can mount an attack israel the united kingdom the united states and russia have taken this approach while western european states generally do not
another major method of preemptive neutralization is interrogation of known or suspected terrorists to obtain information about specific plots targets the identity of other terrorists whether or not the interrogation subjects himself is guilty of terrorist involvement sometimes more extreme methods are used to increase suggestibility such as sleep deprivation or drugs such methods may lead captives to offer false information in an attempt to stop the treatment or due to the confusion brought on by it these methods are not tolerated by european powers in 1978 the european court of human rights ruled in the ireland v united kingdom case that such methods amounted to a practice of inhuman and degrading treatment and that such practices were in breach of the european convention on human rights article 3  art 3 
the human security paradigm outlines a non-military approach which aims to address the enduring underlying inequalities which fuel terrorist activity causal factors need to be delineated and measures implemented which allow equal access to resources and sustainability for all people such activities empower citizens providing  freedom from fear  and  freedom from want 
this can take many forms including the provision of clean drinking water education vaccination programs provision of food and shelter and protection from violence military or otherwise successful human security campaigns have been characterized by the participation of a diverse group of actors including governments ngos and citizens
foreign internal defense programs provide outside expert assistance to a threatened government fid can involve both non-military and military aspects of counter-terrorism
terrorism has often been used to justify military intervention in countries like pakistan where terrorists are said to be based that was the main stated justification for the us invasion of afghanistan it was also a stated justification for the second russian invasion of chechnya
military intervention has not always been successful in stopping or preventing future terrorism like during the malayan emergency the mau mau uprising and most of the campaigns against the ira during the irish civil war the s-plan the border campaign  ira  and the troubles in northern ireland although military action can disrupt a terrorist group s operations temporarily it sometimes doesn t end the threat completely
thus repression by the military in itself  particularly if it is not accompanied by other measures  usually leads to short term victories but tend to be unsuccessful in the long run  eg the french s doctrine described in roger trinquier s book modern war used in indochina and algeria  however new methods  see the new counterinsurgency field manual  such as those taken in iraq have yet to be seen as beneficial or ineffectual
preparation
police fire and emergency medical response organizations have obvious roles local firefighters and emergency medical personnel  often called  first responders   have plans for mitigating the effects of terrorist attacks although police may deal with threats of such attacks
target-hardening
whatever the target of terrorists there are multiple ways of hardening the targets to prevent the terrorists from hitting their mark or reducing the damage of attacks one method is to place jersey barrier or other sturdy obstacles outside tall or politically sensitive buildings to prevent car and truck bombing another way to reduce the impact of attacks is to design buildings for rapid evacuation
aircraft cockpits are kept locked during flights and have reinforced doors which only the pilots in the cabin are capable of opening uk railway stations removed their rubbish bins in response to the provisional ira threat as convenient locations for depositing bombs
scottish stations removed theirs after the 7 july 2005 london bombings as a precautionary measure the massachusetts bay transportation authority purchased bomb-resistant barriers after the september 11 terrorist attacks
a more sophisticated target-hardening approach must consider industrial and other critical industrial infrastructure that could be attacked terrorists need not import chemical weapons if they can cause a major industrial accident such as the bhopal disaster or the halifax explosion industrial chemicals in manufacturing shipping and storage need greater protection and some efforts are in progress to put this risk into perspective the first major lethal chemical attack in wwi used 160 tons of chlorine industrial shipments of chlorine widely used in water purification and the chemical industry travel in 90 or 55 ton tank cars
to give one more example the north american electrical grid has already demonstrated in the northeast blackout of 2003 its vulnerability to natural disasters coupled with inadequate possibly insecure scada  supervisory control and data acquisition  networks part of the vulnerability is due to deregulation leading to much more interconnection in a grid designed for only occasional power-selling between utilities a small number of terrorists attacking key power facilities when one or more engineers have infiltrated the power control centers could wreak havoc
equipping likely targets with containers  ie bags  of pig lard has been utilized to discourage attacks by islamist suicide bombers the technique was apparently used on a limited scale by british authorities in the 1940s the approach stems from the idea that muslims perpetrating the attack would not want to be  soiled  by the lard in the moment prior to dying the idea has been suggested more recently as a deterrent to suicide bombings in israel however the actual effectiveness of this tactic is probably limited as it is possible that a sympathetic islamic scholar could issue a fatwa proclaiming that a suicide bomber would not be polluted by the swine products
command and control
in north america and other continents for a threatened or completed terrorist attack the incident command system  ics  is apt to be invoked to control the various services that may need to be involved in the response ics has varied levels of escalation such as might be needed for multiple incidents in a given area  eg the 2005 bombings in london or the 2004 madrid train bombings or all the way to a national response plan invocation if national-level resources are needed national response for example might be needed for a nuclear biological radiological or large chemical attack
damage mitigation
fire departments perhaps supplemented by public works agencies utility providers  eg gas water electricity  and heavy construction contractors are most apt to deal with the physical consequences of an attack
local security
again under an incident command model local police can isolate the incident area reducing confusion and specialized police units can conduct tactical operations against terrorists often using specialized counter-terrorist tactical units bringing in such units will normally involve civil or military authority beyond the local level
medical services
emergency medical services will triage treat and transport the more seriously affected victims to hospitals which will also need to have mass casualty and triage plans in place
public health agencies from local to national level may be designated to deal with identification and sometimes mitigation of possible biological attacks and sometimes chemical or radiologic contamination
tactical units
today many countries have special units designated to handle terrorist threats besides various security agencies there are elite tactical units also known as special mission units whose role is to directly engage terrorists and prevent terrorist attacks
such units perform both in preventive actions hostage rescue and responding to on-going attacks countries of all sizes can have highly trained counter-terrorist teams tactics techniques and procedures for manhunting are under constant development
most of these measures deal with terrorist attacks that affect an area or threaten to do so it is far harder to deal with assassination or even reprisals on individuals due to the short  if any  warning time and the quick exfiltration of the assassins
these units are specially trained in tactics and are very well equipped for cqb with emphasis on stealth and performing the mission with minimal casualties the units include take-over force  assault teams  snipers eod experts dog handlers and intelligence officers see counter-intelligence and counter-terrorism organizations for national command intelligence and incident mitigation
the majority of counter-terrorism operations at the tactical level are conducted by state federal and national law enforcement agencies or intelligence agencies in some countries the military may be called in as a last resort obviously for countries whose military are legally permitted to conduct police operations this is a non-issue and such counter-terrorism operations are conducted by their military

examples of actions
some counterterrorist actions of the 20th and 21st century are listed below see list of hostage crises for a more extended list including hostage-taking that did not end violently
designing anti-terrorism systems
the scope for anti-terrorism systems is very large in physical terms  long borders vast areas high traffic volumes in busy cities etc  as well as in other dimensions such as type and degree of terrorism threat political and diplomatic ramifications and legal issues in this environment the development of a persistent anti-terrorism protection system is a daunting task such a system should bring together diverse state-of-the-art technologies to enable persistent intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance missions and enable potential actions designing such a system-of-systems comprises a major technological project
a particular design problem for this system is that it will face many uncertainties in the future the threat of terrorism may increase decrease or remain the same the type of terrorism and location are difficult to predict and there are technological uncertainties yet we want to design a terrorism system conceived and designed today in order to prevent acts of terrorism for a decade or more a potential solution is to incorporate flexibility into system design for the reason that the flexibility embedded can be exercised in future as uncertainty unfolds and updated information arrives and the design and valuation of a protection system should not be based on a single scenario but an array of scenarios flexibility can be incorporated in the design of the terrorism system in the form of options that can be exercised in the future when new information is available using these  real options  will create a flexible anti-terrorism system that is able to cope with new requirements that may arise
law enforcement police
while some countries with longstanding terrorism problems such as israel have law enforcement agencies primarily designed to prevent and respond to terror attacks in other nations counter-terrorism is a relatively more recent objective of civilian police and law enforcement agencies
while some civil-libertarians and criminal justice scholars have called-out efforts of law enforcement agencies to combat terrorism as futile and expensive or as threats to civil liberties other scholars have begun describing and analyzing the most important dimensions of the policing of terrorism as an important dimension of counterterrorism especially in the post-9 11 era and have argued how police institutions view terrorism as a matter of crime control such analyses bring out the civilian police role in counterterrorism next to the military model of a  war on terror 
counter-terrorism and american law enforcement
pursuant to passage of the homeland security act of 2002 federal state and local law enforcement agencies began to systemically reorganize two primary federal agencies  the department of justice  doj  and the department of homeland security  dhs   house most of the federal agencies that are prepared to combat domestic and international terrorist attacks these include the border patrol the secret service the coast guard and the fbi
following suit from federal changes pursuant to 9 11 however most state and local law enforcement agencies began to include a commitment to  fighting terrorism  in their mission statements local agencies began to establish more patterned lines of communication with federal agencies some scholars have doubted the ability of local police to help in the war on terror and suggest their limited manpower is still best utilized by engaging community and targeting street crimes
while counter-terror measures  most notably heightened airport security immigrant profiling and border patrol  have been adapted during the last decade to enhance counter-terror in law enforcement there have been remarkable limitations to assessing the actual utility effectiveness of law enforcement practices that are ostensibly preventative thus while sweeping changes in counter-terrorism rhetoric redefined most american post 9 11 law enforcement agencies in theory it is hard to assess how well such hyperbole has translated into practice
in intelligence-led policing ilp  efforts the most quantitatively amenable starting point for measuring the effectiveness of any policing strategy  ie  neighborhood watch gun abatement foot patrols etc  is usually to assess total financial costs against clearance rates or arrest rates since terrorism is such a rare event phenomena measuring arrests or clearance rates would be a non-generalizable and ineffective way to test enforcement policy effectiveness another methodological problem in assessing counter-terrorism efforts in law enforcement hinges on finding operational measures for key concepts in the study of homeland security both terrorism and homeland security are relatively new concepts for criminologists and academicians have yet to agree on the matter of how to properly define these ideas in a way that is accessible
international counter-terrorism agencies
  indicates military organization allowed to operate domestically
military
given the nature of operational counter-terrorism tasks national military organizations do not generally have dedicated units whose sole responsibility is the prosecution of these tasks instead the counter-terrorism function is an element of the role allowing flexibility in their employment with operations being undertaken in the domestic or international context
in some cases the legal framework within which they operate prohibits military units conducting operations in the domestic arena  united states department of defense policy based on the posse comitatus act forbids domestic counter-terrorism operations by the us military units allocated some operational counter-terrorism task are frequently special forces or similar assets
in cases where military organisations do operate in the domestic context some form of formal handover from the law enforcement community is regularly required to ensure adherence to the legislative framework and limitations such as the iranian embassy siege the british police formally turned responsibility over to the special air service when the situation went beyond police capabilities
