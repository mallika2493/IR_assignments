green development - wikipedia
green development is a real estate development concept that carefully considers social and environmental impacts of development however it requires a multi-faceted definition because it can manifest itself through various different ways for example some projects may show more discernable signs of green development than others  solar panels are more visibly  green  than the use of local materials  nevertheless green development is based on solution multipliers  features of a project that provide additional benefits which ultimately reduce the projects  environmental impacts more specifically green development can be defined by three sub-categories  environmental responsiveness resource efficiency and community and cultural sensitivity environmental responsiveness simply respects the intrinsic value of nature and minimizes damage to an ecosystem environmental efficiency refers to the use of fewer resources to conserve energy and the environment community and cultural sensitivity is the component that deviates from concrete environmental elements it recognizes the unique cultural values that each community hosts and carefully considers them in real estate development
the above green development concepts have been derived from the all-inclusive tome released by the rocky mountain institute entitled green development  integrating ecology and real estate


history
green development emerged as a result of the environmental movement in the 1970s green development in real estate however had its infancy in 1897 with a report from the world commission on environment and development entitled our common future the report includes 16 principles of environmental management designed to foster green development it also discusses the traditional model of macroeconomic growth and it disregard for environmental consequences from this initial movement the future experienced a back-and-forth relationship with green methodologies  environmental issues often came second behind purely economic factors incessant environmental concern and legislation including in real estate development began to emerge ie green development however a common concern of green real estate development is that it may increase costs and time hence the ongoing argument of whether sustainability can also be economically feasible national environmental attention has since worked its way down to real estate developers and become quite a hot topic
legislation contributing to green development
in response to increasing public concern regarding environmental issues the government adopted a series of environmental controls in the real estate market for example in california such legislation included the national environmental policy act the nepa process the clean air act the clean water act the coastal zone management act and the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  cercla  the national environmental policy act signed in 1970 changed how federal agencies made decisions because it required them to propose environmental analysis before starting a project the clean air act  1970  requires the epa to set national models for clean air the clean water act  1972  was designed to minimize pollution in natural bodies of water and also to create bodies of water that are clean enough for recreational activities such as fishing or swimming the coastal zone management act  1972  manages the nations coastal resources such as great lakes and estuaries the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act  cercla  is also known as  superfund  it is commonly referred to as  superfund  because it comprises two trust funds that provide help to improve areas that have been polluted by hazardous waste the superfund amendments and reauthorization act of 1986 allows the government to lien a property that is being cleaned up additionally the california environmental quality act  ceqa  is california s most comprehensive piece of legislation regarding the environment this act applies to all decisions made by cities and counties in california and includes the mandate of an environmental impact report  eir  to both public and private projects subsequently any new real estate development is subject to a detailed environmental analysis before starting a project
another piece of legislation promoting a more sustainable approach to development is california s senate bill  sb  375  2008  it aims to achieve california s climate goals via more efficient land use and development patterns more specifically sb 375 seeks to reduce greenhouse gas  ghg  emissions through close coordination between land-use and transportation one way this is achieved is through demand-side measures this strategy would decrease driving demand and therefore reduce vehicle miles traveled  vmt  and ultimately reduce ghg emissions for example a demand-side policy component may include placing public transit stops near development in order to maximize walkability
additionally california state law requires minimum energy conservation levels for all new and or existing development projects the seller of a home is required to include information regarding energy conservation retrofitting and thermal insulation in the sales the contract
green development in practice
broad development patterns
one manifestation of the senate bill 375 is growth management which is an urban panning strategy defined by a close coordination between land-use controls and capital investment and heavily motivated by environmental issues it is defined by  the regulation of the amount timing location and character of development   as the name may suggest growth management may not imply limiting any growth  growth control  carries the connotation of managing or limiting growth and  no growth  would indicate stopping growth all together moreover growth management requires the cooperation of all three of these connotations
urban growth boundaries  ubg s  are popular growth management strategies they are designed to encourage growth within a given boundary and discourage it outside the boundary the goal of the ugb is to promote dense development in order to decrease urban sprawl this growth management technique ultimately seeks to revitalize central cities and create vibrant walk-able spaces for community development
these clustered development patterns are solution multipliers this reduces demand for infrastructure which saves money and resources these multipliers can also include social benefits in additional to environmental ones  clustered development increases walkability which fosters social interaction and community togetherness

boulder colorado
growth management limitation  discussed previously  manifests itself in boulder colorado the city of boulder very tightly restricts housing development by limiting housing permits to 400 per year which is 1 percent of the city s total housing stock additionally the city has purchased land outside of the city limits designated for permanent green open space this 400-unit cap seriously hinders population growth in the city this shortage of housing has several repercussions first of all it increases housing prices also because boulder restricts housing development more than it does commercial development the number of available workers in boulder grows faster than the housing stock this results in many workers who commute from beyond the city limits
opposition
a common critique of green development is that it negatively affects the way real estate developers do business as some green development strategies increases expenses and create delay developers must work within the confines of legislation that now includes environmental consideration
