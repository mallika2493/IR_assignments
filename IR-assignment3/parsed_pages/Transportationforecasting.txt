transportation forecasting - wikipedia
transportation forecasting is the attempt of estimating the number of vehicles or people that will use a specific transportation facility in the future for instance a forecast may estimate the number of vehicles on a planned road or bridge the ridership on a railway line the number of passengers visiting an airport or the number of ships calling on a seaport traffic forecasting begins with the collection of data on current traffic this traffic data is combined with other known data such as population employment trip rates travel costs etc to develop a traffic demand model for the current situation feeding it with predicted data for population employment etc results in estimates of future traffic typically estimated for each segment of the transportation infrastructure in question eg for each roadway segment or railway station
traffic forecasts are used for several key purposes in transportation policy planning and engineering  to calculate the capacity of infrastructure eg how many lanes a bridge should have  to estimate the financial and social viability of projects eg using cost benefit analysis and social impact assessment  and to calculate environmental impacts eg air pollution and noise


four-step models
within the rational planning framework transportation forecasts have traditionally followed the sequential four-step model or urban transportation planning  utp  procedure first implemented on mainframe computers in the 1950s at the detroit metropolitan area traffic study and chicago area transportation study  cats 
land-use forecasting starts the process typically forecasts are made for the region as a whole eg of population growth such forecasts provide control totals for the local land use analysis typically the region is divided into zones and by trend or regression analysis the population and employment are determined for each
the four steps of the classical urban transportation planning system model are 
after the classical model there is an evaluation according to an agreed set of decision criteria and parameters a typical criterion is cost benefit analysis such analysis might be applied after the network assignment model identifies needed capacity  is such capacity worthwhile  in addition to identifying the forecasting and decision steps as additional steps in the process it is important to note that forecasting and decision-making permeate each step in the utp process planning deals with the future and it is forecasting dependent
activity-based models
activity-based models are another class of models that predict for individuals where and when specific activities  eg work leisure shopping   are conducted
partial and fully operational activity-based simulation systems include 
the major premise behind activity-based models is that travel demand is derived from activities that people need or wish to perform with travel decisions forming part of the scheduling decisions travel is then seen as just one of the attributes of a system the travel model is therefore set within the context of an agenda as a component of an activity scheduling decision
activity-based models offer other possibilities than four-step models eg to model environmental issues such as emissions and exposure to air pollution although their obvious advantages for environmental purposes were recognized by shiftan almost a decade ago applications to exposure models remain scarce activity-based models have recently been used to predict emissions  and air quality  they can also provide a better total estimate of exposure while also enabling the disaggregation of individual exposure over activities they can therefore be used to reduce exposure misclassification and establish relationships between health impacts and air quality more precisely policy makers can use activity-based models to devise strategies that reduce exposure by changing time activity patterns or that target specific groups in the population
a method based on percolation theory was developed by daqing li  to characterize the global quality of traffic in a city the method can be also used to identify significant and recurrent bottlenecks in different rush-hours
precursor steps
although not identified as steps in the utp process a lot of data gathering is involved in the utp analysis process census and land use data are obtained along with home interview surveys and journey surveys home interview surveys land use data and special trip attraction surveys provide the information on which the utp analysis tools are exercised
data collection management and processing  model estimation  and use of models to yield plans are much used techniques in the utp process in the early days in the usa census data was augmented that with data collection methods that had been developed by the bureau of public roads  a predecessor of the federal highway administration   traffic counting procedures cordon  where are you coming from and where are you going  counts and home interview techniques protocols for coding networks and the notion of analysis or traffic zones emerged at the cats
model estimation used existing techniques and plans were developed using whatever models had been developed in a study the main difference between now and then is the development of some analytic resources specific to transportation planning in addition to the bpr data acquisition techniques used in the early days
critique
the sequential and aggregate nature of transportation forecasting has come under much criticism while improvements have been made in particular giving an activity-base to travel demand much remains to be done in the 1990s most federal investment in model research went to the transims project at los alamos national laboratory developed by physicists while the use of supercomputers and the detailed simulations may be an improvement on practice they have yet to be shown to be better  more accurate  than conventional models a commercial version was spun off to ibm and an open source version is also being actively maintained as transims open-source
one of the major oversights in the use of transportation models in practice is the absence of any feedback from transportation models on land use highways and transit investments not only respond to land use they shape it as well
