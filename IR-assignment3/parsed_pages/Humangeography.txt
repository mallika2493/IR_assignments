human geography - wikipedia
human geography is the branch of the social sciences that deals with the study of people and their communities cultures economies and interaction with the environment by noticing their relations with and across space and place as an intellectual discipline geography is divided into the sub-fields of physical geography and human geography the latter concentrating upon the study of human activities by the application of qualitative and quantitative research methods


history
geography was not recognised as a formal academic discipline until the 18th century although many scholars had undertaken geographical scholarship for much longer particularly through cartography
the royal geographical society was founded in england in 1830 although the united kingdom did not get its first full chair of geography until 1917 the first real geographical intellect to emerge in united kingdom geography was halford john mackinder appointed reader at oxford university in 1887
the national geographic society was founded in the united states in 1888 and began publication of the national geographic magazine which became and continues to be a great populariser of geographic information the society has long supported geographic research and education
one of the first examples of geographic methods being used for purposes other than to describe and theorise the physical properties of the earth is john snow s map of the 1854 broad street cholera outbreak though a physician and a pioneer of epidemiology the map is probably one of the earliest examples of health geography
the now fairly distinct differences between the subfields of physical and human geography developed at a later date this connection between both physical and human properties of geography is most apparent in the theory of environmental determinism made popular in the 19th century by carl ritter and others and with close links to evolutionary biology of the time environmental determinism is the theory that a people s physical mental and moral habits are directly due to the influence of their natural environment however by the mid-19th century environmental determinism was under attack for lacking methodological rigour associated with modern science and later as serving to justify racism and imperialism
a similar concern with both human and physical aspects is apparent in the later regional geography during the later 19th and first half of the 20th centuries the goal of regional geography through regionalization was to delineate space into regions and then understand and describe the unique characteristics of each region in both human and physical aspects with links to possibilism and cultural ecology some of the same notions of causal effect of the environment on society and culture as with environmental determinism remained
by the 1960s however the quantitative revolution led to strong criticism of regional geography due to a perceived lack of scientific rigour in and overly descriptive nature of the discipline and a continued separation of geography from geology and the two subfields of physical and human geography geographers in the mid-20th century began to apply statistical and mathematical model methods to solving spatial problems much of the development during the quantitative revolution is now apparent in the use of geographic information systems  the use of statistics spatial modelling and positivist approaches is still important to many branches of human geography well-known geographers from this period are fred k schaefer waldo tobler william garrison peter haggett richard j chorley william bunge and torsten h gerstrand
from the 1970s a number of critiques of the positivism now associated with geography emerged known under the term  critical geography  this signalled another turning point in the discipline behavioural geography emerged for some time as a means to understand how people made perceived spaces and places and made locational decisions more influentially  radical geography  emerged in the 1970s and 1980s drawing heavily on marxist theory and techniques and is associated with geographers such as david harvey and richard peet seeking to say something  meaningful  about the problems recognised through quantitative methods to provide explanations rather than descriptions to put forward alternatives and solutions and to be politically engaged rather than the detachment associated with positivist methods  the detachment and objectivity of the quantitative revolution was itself critiqued by radical geographers as being a tool of capital  radical geography and the links to marxism and related theories remain an important part of contemporary human geography  see  antipode  journal   critical geography also saw the introduction of  humanistic geography  associated with the work of yi-fu tuan which though similar to behavioural geography pushed for a much more qualitative approach in methodology
the changes under critical geography have led to contemporary approaches in the discipline such as feminist geography new cultural geography and the engagement with postmodern and post-structural theories and philosophies
fields
the main fields of study in human geography focus around the core fields of 
culture
cultural geography is the study of cultural products and norms - their variation across spaces and places as well as their relations it focuses on describing and analysing the ways language religion economy government and other cultural phenomena vary or remain constant from one place to another and on explaining how humans function spatially
development
development geography is the study of the earth s geography with reference to the standard of living and the quality of life of its human inhabitants study of the location distribution and spatial organization of economic activities across the earth the subject matter investigated is strongly influenced by the researcher s methodological approach
economic
economic geography examines relationships between human economic systems states and other factors and the biophysical environment
health
health geography is the application of geographical information perspectives and methods to the study of health disease and health care
historical
historical geography is the study of the human physical fictional theoretical and  real  geographies of the past historical geography studies a wide variety of issues and topics a common theme is the study of the geographies of the past and how a place or region changes through time many historical geographers study geographical patterns through time including how people have interacted with their environment and created the cultural landscape
political
political geography is concerned with the study of both the spatially uneven outcomes of political processes and the ways in which political processes are themselves affected by spatial structures
population
population geography is the study of the ways in which spatial variations in the distribution composition migration and growth of populations are related to the nature of places
settlement
settlement geography including urban geography is the study of urban and rural areas with specific regards to spatial relational and theoretical aspects of settlement that is the study of areas which have a concentration of buildings and infrastructure these are areas where the majority of economic activities are in the secondary sector and tertiary sectors in case of urban settlement they probably have a high population density
philosophical and theoretical approaches
within each of the subfields various philosophical approaches can be used in research  therefore an urban geographer could be a feminist or marxist geographer etc
such approaches are

journals
as with all social sciences human geographers publish research and other written work in a variety of academic journals whilst human geography is interdisciplinary there are a number of journals with as human geography focus
these include
