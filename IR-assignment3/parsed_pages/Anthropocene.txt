anthropocene - wikipedia
the anthropocene is a proposed epoch that begins when human activities started to have a significant global impact on earth s geology and ecosystems neither the international commission on stratigraphy nor the international union of geological sciences has yet officially approved the term as a recognized subdivision of geological time although the working group on the anthropocene  wga  has voted to formally designate the epoch anthropocene and presented the recommendation to the international geological congress on 29 august 2016
the term  anthropocene  appears to have been used by scientists within the soviet union as early as the 1960s to refer to the quaternary the most recent geological period anthropocene was subsequently used with a different sense in the 1980s by ecologist eugene f stoermer and has been widely popularized by atmospheric chemist paul j crutzen in 2000 who regards the influence of human behavior on earth s atmosphere in recent centuries as so significant as to constitute a new geological epoch for its lithosphere a january 2016 paper in science investigating climatic biological and geochemical signatures of human activity in sediments and ice cores suggested the era since the mid-20th century should be recognised as a distinct geological epoch from the holocene
in 2008 a proposal was presented to the stratigraphy commission of the geological society of london to make the anthropocene a formal unit of geological epoch divisions a large majority of that stratigraphy commission decided the proposal had merit and should be examined further steps are being taken by independent working groups of scientists from various geological societies to determine whether the anthropocene will be formally accepted into the geological time scale
nevertheless many scientists are now using the term  anthropocene  and the geological society of america entitled its 2011 annual meeting  archean to anthropocene  the past is the key to the future the anthropocene has no agreed start date but some scientists propose that based on atmospheric evidence it may be considered to start with the industrial revolution  late eighteenth century  other scientists link the new term to earlier events such as the rise of agriculture and the neolithic revolution  around 12,000 years bp  evidence of relative human impact such as the growing human influence on land use ecosystems biodiversity and species extinction is controversial  some scientists think the human impact has significantly changed  or halted  the growth of biodiversity those arguing for earlier dates posit that the proposed anthropocene may have begun as early as 14,000 to 15,000 years before present based on lithospheric evidence  this has led other scientists to suggest that  the onset of the anthropocene should be extended back many thousand years   1 this would be closely synchronous with the current term holocene
in january 2015 26 of the 38 members of the international anthropocene working group published a paper suggesting that the trinity test on july 16 1945 was the starting point of the proposed new epoch however a significant minority supports one of several alternative dates in march 2015 a paper published in nature suggested either 1610 or 1964 could be the beginning of anthropocene other scholars point to the diachronous character of the physical strata of the anthropocene arguing that onset and impact are spread out over time not reducible to a single instant or date of start
the anthropocene working group met in oslo in april 2016 to consolidate evidence supporting the argument that the anthropocene is a true geologic epoch evidence was evaluated and the group voted to recommend anthropocene as the new geological age in august 2016 should the recommendation be approved by the international commission on stratigraphy the proposal to adopt the term will have to be ratified by the international union of geological sciences before its formal adoption as part of the geologic time scale


etymology
the name anthropocene is a combination of greek roots  anthropo-  greek             meaning  human  and -cene meaning  new  or  recent  the epochs had been named for their estimated percentage of recent fossils for example the holocene has entirely recent fossil genera and species the epoch names have undergone some revision since their establishment and no longer refer to estimates based on fossil assemblies all epochs in the cenozoic era end in  -cene 
while the biologist eugene stoermer is often credited with coining the term anthropocene it was in geological informal usage in the mid-1970s paul crutzen independently re-invented and popularized it stoermer wrote  i began using the term  anthropocene  in the 1980s but never formalized it until paul contacted me  crutzen has explained  i was at a conference where someone said something about the holocene i suddenly thought this was wrong the world has changed too much so i said   no we are in the anthropocene  i just made up the word on the spur of the moment everyone was shocked but it seems to have stuck  21 in 2008 zalasiewicz suggested in gsa today that an anthropocene epoch is now appropriate
as early as 1873 the italian geologist antonio stoppani acknowledged the increasing power and effect of humanity on the earth s systems and referred to an  anthropozoic era 
nature of human effects
biodiversity
the human impact on biodiversity forms one of the primary attributes of the anthropocene humankind has entered what is sometimes called the earth s sixth major extinction most experts agree that human activities have accelerated the rate of species extinction the exact rate remains controversial   perhaps 100 to 1000 times the normal background rate of extinction in 2010 a study published in nature found that  marine phytoplankton   the vast range of tiny algae species accounting for roughly half of earth s total photosynthetic biomass   had declined substantially in the world s oceans over the past century from 1950 alone algal biomass decreased by around 40  probably in response to ocean warming   and that the decline had gathered pace in recent years some authors have postulated that without human impacts the biodiversity of the planet would continue to grow at an exponential rate   implying that human activities accelerate or exacerbate global warming
increases in global rates of extinction have been elevated above background rates since at least 1500 and appear to have accelerated in the 19th century and further since a 13 july 2012 new york times op-ed by ecologist roger bradbury predicted the end of biodiversity for the oceans labelling coral reefs doomed   coral reefs will be the first but certainly not the last major ecosystem to succumb to the anthropocene  this op-ed quickly generated much discussion among conservationists  the nature conservancy rebutted bradbury on its website defending its position of protecting coral reefs despite continued human impacts causing reef declines
in a pair of studies published in 2015 extrapolation from observed extinction of hawaiian snails led to the conclusion that  the biodiversity crisis is real  and that 7  of all species on earth may have disappeared already human predation was noted as being unique in the history of life on earth as being a globally distributed  superpredator  with predation of the adults of other apex predators and with widespread impacts on food webs worldwide
biogeography
permanent changes in the distribution of organisms from human influence will be identifiable in the geologic record many species have been documented moving into regions that were once too cold for them often at rates faster than initially expected this has occurred in part as a result of evolving climate but also in response to farming and fishing and the accidental introduction of non-native species to new areas by global travel the ecosystem of the entire black sea may have changed during the last 2000 years as a result of nutrient and silica input from eroding deforested lands along the danube river
climate
one geological symptom resulting from human activity is increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide  co2  content during the glacial interglacial cycles of the past million years natural processes have varied co2 by approximately 100 ppm  from 180 ppm to 280 ppm  as of 2013 anthropogenic net emissions of co2 increased atmospheric concentration by a comparable amount from 280 ppm  holocene or pre-industrial  equilibrium   to approximately 400 ppm with 2015 16 monthly monitoring data of co2 displaying a rising trend above 400 ppm this signal in the earth s climate system is especially significant because it is occurring much faster and to an enormously greater extent than previous similar changes most of this increase is due to the combustion of fossil fuels such as coal oil and gas although smaller fractions are the result of cement production and land-use changes  eg deforestation 
geomorphology
changes in drainage patterns traceable to human activity will persist over geologic time in large parts of the continents where the geologic regime is erosional this includes the paths of roads and highways defined by their grading and drainage control direct changes to the form of the earth s surface by human activities  eg quarrying landscaping  also record human impacts
stratigraphy
human activities like deforestation and road construction are believed to have elevated average total sediment fluxes across the earth s surface however construction of dams on many rivers around the world mean the rates of sediment deposition in any given place do not always appear to increase in the anthropocene for instance many river deltas around the world are actually currently starved of sediment by such dams and are subsiding and failing to keep up with sea level rise rather than growing
increases in erosion due to farming and other operations will be reflected by changes in sediment composition and increases in deposition rates elsewhere in land areas with a depositional regime engineered structures will tend to be buried and preserved along with litter and debris litter and debris thrown from boats or carried by rivers and creeks will accumulate in the marine environment particularly in coastal areas such manmade artifacts preserved in stratigraphy are known as  technofossils 
changes in biodiversity will also be reflected in the fossil record as will species introductions an example cited is the domestic chicken originally the red junglefowl gallus gallus native to south-east asia but has since become the world s most common bird through human breeding and consumption with over 60 billion consumed a year and whose bones would become fossilized in landfill sites
in terms of trace elements there are distinct signatures left by modern societies for example in the upper fremont glacier in wyoming there is a layer of chlorine present in ice cores from 1960s atomic weapon testing programs as well as a layer of mercury associated with coal plants in the 1980s from 1945 to 1951 nuclear fallout is found locally around atomic device test sites whereas from 1952 to 1980 tests of thermonuclear devices have left a clear global signal of excess 14c 239pu and other artificial radionuclides the highest concentration of radionuclides was in 1964 one of the dates which has been proposed as a possible benchmark for the start of the formally defined anthropocene
human burning of fossil fuels has also left distinctly elevated concentrations of black carbon inorganic ash and spherical carbonaceous particles in recent sediments across the world concentrations of these components increases markedly and almost simultaneously around the world beginning around 1950
anthropocene temporal limit
the anthropocene working group voted on the  base beginning of the anthropocene  and most members favored some time around 1950
 early anthropocene  model
while much of the environmental change occurring on earth is suspected to be a direct consequence of the industrial revolution william ruddiman has argued that the proposed anthropocene began approximately 8,000 years ago with the development of farming and sedentary cultures at this point humans were dispersed across all of the continents  except antarctica  and the neolithic revolution was ongoing during this period humans developed agriculture and animal husbandry to supplement or replace hunter-gatherer subsistence such innovations were followed by a wave of extinctions beginning with large mammals and land birds this wave was driven by both the direct activity of humans  eg hunting  and the indirect consequences of land-use change for agriculture
from the past to present some authors consider the anthropocene and the holocene to be the same or coeval geologic time span others that the onset of the anthropocene was just a bit more recent ruddiman claims that the anthropocene as defined by significant human impact on greenhouse gas emissions began not in the industrial era but 8,000 years ago as ancient farmers cleared forests to grow crops ruddiman s work has in turn been challenged on the grounds that comparison with an earlier interglaciation   stage 11  approximately 400,000 years ago  suggests that 16,000 more years must elapse before the current holocene interglaciation comes to an end and that thus the early anthropogenic hypothesis is invalid ruddiman argues in rebuttal that this results from an invalid alignment of recent insolation maxima with insolation minima from the past among other irregularities which invalidate the criticism furthermore the argument that  something  is needed to explain the differences in the holocene is challenged by more recent research showing that all interglacials differ
although 8,000 years ago the planet sustained a few million people and was still fundamentally pristine this is the basis for an assertion that an early date for the proposed anthropocene term does account for a substantial human footprint on earth
antiquity
a plausible starting point of the anthropocene could be at c 2,000 years ago which roughly coincides with the start of the final phase of holocene the subatlantic
at this time the roman empire encompassed large portions of europe the middle east and north africa in china the classical dynasties were flowering the middle kingdoms of india had already the largest economy of the ancient and medieval world the napata meroitic kingdom extended over the current sudan and ethiopia the olmecs controlled central mexico and guatemala and the pre-incan chav n people managed large areas of northern peru although often apart from each other and intermixed with buffering ecosystems the areas directly impacted by these civilizations and others were large additionally some activities such as mining implied much more widespread perturbation of natural conditions
industrial revolution
crutzen proposed the industrial revolution as the start of anthropocene lovelock proposes that the anthropocene began with the first application of the newcomen atmospheric engine in 1712 although it is apparent that the industrial revolution ushered in an unprecedented global human impact on the planet much of earth s landscape already had been profoundly modified by human activities the human impact on earth has grown progressively with few substantial slowdowns
anthropocene marker
a marker that accounts for a substantial global impact of humans on the total environment comparable in scale to those associated with significant perturbations of the geological past is needed in place of minor changes in atmosphere composition
a useful candidate for this purpose is the pedosphere which can retain information of its climatic and geochemical history with features lasting for centuries or millennia human activity is now firmly established as the sixth factor of soil formation it affects pedogenesis either directly by for example land levelling trenching and embankment building for various purposes organic matter enrichment from additions of manure or other waste organic matter impoverishment due to continued cultivation compaction from overgrazing or indirectly by drift of eroded materials or pollutants anthropogenic soils are those markedly affected by human activities such as repeated ploughing the addition of fertilizers contamination sealing or enrichment with artefacts  in the world reference base for soil resources they are classified as anthrosols and technosols  they are recalcitrant repositories of artefacts and properties that testify to the dominance of the human impact and hence appear to be reliable markers for the anthropocene some anthropogenic soils may be viewed as the  golden spikes  of geologists  global boundary stratotype section and point  which are locations where there are strata successions with clear evidences of a worldwide event including the appearance of distinctive fossils drilling for fossil fuels has also created holes and tubes which are expected to be detectable for millions of years
in culture
the concept of the anthropocene has also been approached via humanities such as philosophy literature and art in the scholarly world it has been the subject of increasing attention through special journal issues conferences and disciplinary reports the anthropocene its attendant timescale and ecological implications prompts questions about death and the ends of civilization memory and archives the scope and methods of humanistic inquiry and emotional responses to the  end of nature  it has been also criticized as an ideological construct some environmentalists on the political left such as jason w moore suggest that  capitalocene  is a more historically appropriate term according to jedediah purdy law professor at duke university  anthropocene is too focused on humanity as a species and as a result it ignores the systematic forms of inequality such as imperialism and racism which have shaped the world
