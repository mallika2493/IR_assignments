gross domestic product - wikipedia
gross domestic product  gdp  is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a period  quarterly or yearly  nominal gdp estimates are commonly used to determine the economic performance of a whole country or region and to make international comparisons nominal gdp per capita does not however reflect differences in the cost of living and the inflation rates of the countries  therefore using a gdp ppp per capita basis is arguably more useful when comparing differences in living standards between nations


definition
the oecd defines gdp as  an aggregate measure of production equal to the sum of the gross values added of all resident and institutional units engaged in production  plus any taxes and minus any subsidies on products not included in the value of their outputs   an imf publication states that  gdp measures the monetary value of final goods and services - that is those that are bought by the final user - produced in a country in a given period of time  say a quarter or a year  
total gdp can also be broken down into the relative contribution of each industry or sector of the economy
history
william petty came up with a basic concept of gdp to defend landlords against unfair taxation during warfare between the dutch and the english between 1652 and 1674 charles davenant developed the method further in 1695 the modern concept of gdp was first developed by simon kuznets for a us congress report in 1934 in this report kuznets warned against its use as a measure of welfare  see below under limitations and criticisms  after the bretton woods conference in 1944 gdp became the main tool for measuring a country s economy at that time gross national product  gnp  was the preferred estimate which differed from gdp in that it measured production by a country s citizens at home and abroad rather than its  resident institutional units   see oecd definition above  the switch from  gnp  to  gdp  in the us was in 1991 trailing behind most other nations
determining gross domestic product  gdp 
gdp can be determined in three ways all of which should in principle give the same result they are the production  or output or value added  approach the income approach or the expenditure approach
the most direct of the three is the production approach which sums the outputs of every class of enterprise to arrive at the total the expenditure approach works on the principle that all of the product must be bought by somebody therefore the value of the total product must be equal to people s total expenditures in buying things the income approach works on the principle that the incomes of the productive factors   producers  colloquially  must be equal to the value of their product and determines gdp by finding the sum of all producers  incomes
production approach
this approach mirrors the oecd definition given above
gross value added   gross value of output   value of intermediate consumption
value of output   value of the total sales of goods and services plus value of changes in the inventories
the sum of the gross value added in the various economic activities is known as  gdp at factor cost 
gdp at factor cost plus indirect taxes less subsidies on products    gdp at producer price 
for measuring output of domestic product economic activities  ie industries  are classified into various sectors after classifying economic activities the output of each sector is calculated by any of the following two methods 
the gross value of all sectors is then added to get the gross value added  gva  at factor cost subtracting each sector s intermediate consumption from gross output gives the gdp at factor cost adding indirect tax minus subsidies in gdp at factor cost gives the  gdp at producer prices 
income approach
the second way of estimating gdp is to use  the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units 
if gdp is calculated this way it is sometimes called gross domestic income  gdi  or gdp  i  gdi should provide the same amount as the expenditure method described later  by definition gdi   gdp in practice however measurement errors will make the two figures slightly off when reported by national statistical agencies 
this method measures gdp by adding incomes that firms pay households for factors of production they hire - wages for labour interest for capital rent for land and profits for entrepreneurship
the us  national income and expenditure accounts  divide incomes into five categories 
these five income components sum to net domestic income at factor cost
two adjustments must be made to get gdp 
total income can be subdivided according to various schemes leading to various formulae for gdp measured by the income approach a common one is 
the sum of coe gos and gmi is called total factor income  it is the income of all of the factors of production in society it measures the value of gdp at factor  basic  prices the difference between basic prices and final prices  those used in the expenditure calculation  is the total taxes and subsidies that the government has levied or paid on that production so adding taxes less subsidies on production and imports converts gdp at factor cost to gdp i 
total factor income is also sometimes expressed as 
expenditure approach
the third way to estimate gdp is to calculate the sum of the final uses of goods and services  all uses except intermediate consumption  measured in purchasers  prices
market goods which are produced are purchased by someone in the case where a good is produced and unsold the standard accounting convention is that the producer has bought the good from themselves therefore measuring the total expenditure used to buy things is a way of measuring production this is known as the expenditure method of calculating gdp
gdp  y  is the sum of consumption  c  investment  i  government spending  g  and net exports  x   m 
here is a description of each gdp component 
note that c g and i are expenditures on final goods and services  expenditures on intermediate goods and services do not count  intermediate goods and services are those used by businesses to produce other goods and services within the accounting year  
according to the us bureau of economic analysis which is responsible for calculating the national accounts in the united states  in general the source data for the expenditures components are considered more reliable than those for the income components  g d p
gdp vs gni
gdp can be contrasted with gross national product  gnp  or as it is now known gross national income  gni  the difference is that gdp defines its scope according to location while gni defines its scope according to ownership in a global context world gdp and world gni are therefore equivalent terms
gdp is product produced within a country s borders  gni is product produced by enterprises owned by a country s citizens the two would be the same if all of the productive enterprises in a country were owned by its own citizens and those citizens did not own productive enterprises in any other countries in practice however foreign ownership makes gdp and gni non-identical production within a country s borders but by an enterprise owned by somebody outside the country counts as part of its gdp but not its gni  on the other hand production by an enterprise located outside the country but owned by one of its citizens counts as part of its gni but not its gdp
for example the gni of the usa is the value of output produced by american-owned firms regardless of where the firms are located similarly if a country becomes increasingly in debt and spends large amounts of income servicing this debt this will be reflected in a decreased gni but not a decreased gdp similarly if a country sells off its resources to entities outside their country this will also be reflected over time in decreased gni but not decreased gdp this would make the use of gdp more attractive for politicians in countries with increasing national debt and decreasing assets
gross national income  gni  equals gdp plus income receipts from the rest of the world minus income payments to the rest of the world
in 1991 the united states switched from using gnp to using gdp as its primary measure of production the relationship between united states gdp and gnp is shown in table 1.7.5 of the national income and product accounts
international standards
the international standard for measuring gdp is contained in the book system of national accounts  1993  which was prepared by representatives of the international monetary fund european union organization for economic co-operation and development united nations and world bank the publication is normally referred to as sna93 to distinguish it from the previous edition published in 1968  called sna68  
sna93 provides a set of rules and procedures for the measurement of national accounts the standards are designed to be flexible to allow for differences in local statistical needs and conditions
national measurement
within each country gdp is normally measured by a national government statistical agency as private sector organizations normally do not have access to the information required  especially information on expenditure and production by governments 
nominal gdp and adjustments to gdp
the raw gdp figure as given by the equations above is called the nominal historical or current gdp when one compares gdp figures from one year to another it is desirable to compensate for changes in the value of money   ie for the effects of inflation or deflation to make it more meaningful for year-to-year comparisons it may be multiplied by the ratio between the value of money in the year the gdp was measured and the value of money in a base year
for example suppose a country s gdp in 1990 was  100 million and its gdp in 2000 was  300 million suppose also that inflation had halved the value of its currency over that period to meaningfully compare its gdp in 2000 to its gdp in 1990 we could multiply the gdp in 2000 by one-half to make it relative to 1990 as a base year the result would be that the gdp in 2000 equals  300 million   one-half    150 million in 1990 monetary terms we would see that the country s gdp had realistically increased 50 percent over that period not 200 percent as it might appear from the raw gdp data the gdp adjusted for changes in money value in this way is called the real or constant gdp
the factor used to convert gdp from current to constant values in this way is called the gdp deflator unlike consumer price index which measures inflation or deflation in the price of household consumer goods the gdp deflator measures changes in the prices of all domestically produced goods and services in an economy including investment goods and government services as well as household consumption goods
constant-gdp figures allow us to calculate a gdp growth rate which indicates how much a country s production has increased  or decreased if the growth rate is negative  compared to the previous year
another thing that it may be desirable to account for is population growth if a country s gdp doubled over a certain period but its population tripled the increase in gdp may not mean that the standard of living increased for the country s residents  the average person in the country is producing less than they were before per-capita gdp is a measure to account for population growth
cross-border comparison and purchasing power parity
the level of gdp in different countries may be compared by converting their value in national currency according to either the current currency exchange rate or the purchasing power parity exchange rate
the ranking of countries may differ significantly based on which method is used
there is a clear pattern of the purchasing power parity method decreasing the disparity in gdp between high and low income  gdp  countries as compared to the current exchange rate method this finding is called the penn effect

standard of living and gdp  wealth distribution and externalities
gdp per capita is often used as an indicator of living standards
the major advantage of gdp per capita as an indicator of standard of living is that it is measured frequently widely and consistently it is measured frequently in that most countries provide information on gdp on a quarterly basis allowing trends to be seen quickly it is measured widely in that some measure of gdp is available for almost every country in the world allowing inter-country comparisons it is measured consistently in that the technical definition of gdp is relatively consistent among countries
gdp does not include several factors that influence the standard of living in particular it fails to account for 
it can be argued that gdp per capita as an indicator standard of living is correlated with these factors capturing them indirectly as a result gdp per capita as a standard of living is a continued usage because most people have a fairly accurate idea of what it is and know it is tough to come up with quantitative measures for such constructs as happiness quality of life and well-being
limitations and criticisms
simon kuznets the economist who developed the first comprehensive set of measures of national income stated in his first report to the us congress in 1934 in a section titled  uses and abuses of national income measurements  
in 1962 kuznets stated 
the uk s natural capital committee highlighted the shortcomings of gdp in its advice to the uk government in 2013 pointing out that gdp  focusses on flows not stocks as a result an economy can run down its assets yet at the same time record high levels of gdp growth until a point is reached where the depleted assets act as a check on future growth  they then went on to say that  it is apparent that the recorded gdp growth rate overstates the sustainable growth rate broader measures of wellbeing and wealth are needed for this and there is a danger that short-term decisions based solely on what is currently measured by national accounts may prove to be costly in the long-term 
many environmentalists argue that gdp is a poor measure of social progress because it does not take into account harm to the environment
in 1989 leading ecological economist and steady-state theorist herman daly and theologian john b cobb developed the index of sustainable economic welfare  isew  which they proposed as a more valid measure of socio-economic progress by taking into account various other factors such as consumption of nonrenewable resources and degradation of the environment
although a high or rising level of gdp is often associated with increased economic and social progress within a country a number of scholars have pointed out that this does not necessarily play out in many instances for example jean dr ze and amartya sen have pointed out that an increase in gdp or in gdp growth does not necessarily lead to a higher standard of living particularly in areas such as healthcare and education another important area that does not necessarily improve along with gdp is political liberty which is most notable in china where gdp growth is strong yet political liberties are heavily restricted
gdp does not account for the distribution of income among the residents of a country because gdp is merely an aggregate measure an economy may be highly developed or growing rapidly but also contain a wide gap between the rich and the poor in a society these inequalities often occur on the lines of race ethnicity gender religion or other minority status within countries this can lead to misleading characterizations of economic well-being if the income distribution is heavily skewed toward the high end as the poorer residents will not directly benefit from the overall level of wealth and income generated in their country even gdp per capita measures may have the same downside if inequality is high for example south africa during apartheid ranked high in terms of gdp per capita but the benefits of this immense wealth and income were not shared equally among the country
gdp does not take into account the value of household and other unpaid work some including martha nussbaum argue that this value should be included in measuring gdp as household labor is largely a substitute for goods and services that would otherwise be purchased for value even under conservative estimates the value of unpaid labor in australia has been calculated to be over 50  of the country s gdp a later study analyzed this value in other countries with results ranging from a low of about 15  in canada  using conservative estimates  to high of nearly 70  in the united kingdom  using more liberal estimates  for the united states the value was estimated to be between about 20  on the low end to nearly 50  on the high end depending on the methodology being used because many public policies are shaped by gdp calculations and by the related field of national accounts the non-inclusion of unpaid work in calculating gdp can create distortions in public policy and some economists have advocated for changes in the way public policies are formed and implemented
in response to these and other limitations of using gdp as the overarching measure of economic and social progress alternative approaches have emerged one such alternative is the capability approach which was developed in the 1980s and focuses on the functional capabilities enjoyed by people within a country rather than the aggregate wealth held within a country these capabilities consist of the functions that a person is able to achieve
