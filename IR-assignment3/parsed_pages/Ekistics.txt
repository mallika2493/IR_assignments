ekistics - wikipedia
ekistics concerns the science of human settlements including regional city community planning and dwelling design the study involves every kind of human settlement with particular attention to geography ecology human psychology anthropology culture politics and occasionally aesthetics
as a scientific mode of study ekistics currently relies on statistics and description organized in five ekistic elements or principles  nature anthropos society shells and networks it is generally a more scientific field than urban planning and has considerable overlap with some of the less restrained fields of architectural theory
in application conclusions are drawn aimed at achieving harmony between the inhabitants of a settlement and their physical and socio-cultural environments


etymology
the term  ekistics  was coined by constantinos apostolos doxiadis in 1942 the word is derived from the greek adjective            more particularly from the neuter plural           the ancient greek adjective            meant   concerning the foundation of a house a habitation a city or colony  contributing to the settling  it was derived from          an ancient greek noun meaning  the person who installs settlers in place  this may be regarded as deriving indirectly from another ancient greek noun         meaning  building   housing   habitation  and especially  establishment of a colony a settlement  or a town   already in plato  or  filling with new settlers  settling   being settled  all these words grew from the verb        to settle and were ultimately derived from the noun        house   home  or  habitat
the shorter oxford english dictionary contains a reference to an oecist oekist or oikist defining him as   the founder of an ancient greek  colony  the english equivalent of oikistikh is ekistics  a noun  in addition the adjectives ekistic and ekistical the adverb ekistically and the noun ekistician are now also in current use the french equivalent is  kistique the german oekistik the italian echistica  all feminine 
scope
in terms of outdoor recreation the term ekistic relationship is used to describe one s relationship with the natural world and how they view the resources with in it
the notion of ekistics implies that understanding the interaction between and within human groups infrastructure agriculture shelter function  job  -- in conjunction with their environment directly affects their well-being  individual and collective  the subject begins to elucidate the ways in which collective settlements form and how they inter-relate by doing so humans begin to understand how they  fit  into a species ie homo sapiens and how homo sapiens  should  be living in order to manifest our potential at least as far as this species is concerned  as the text stands now  ekistics in some cases argues that in order for human settlements to expand efficiently and economically we must reorganize the way in which the villages towns cities metropoli are formed
as doxiadis put it  ekistics is a science even if in our times it is usually considered a technology and an art without the foundations of a science this is a mistake for which we pay very heavily  having recorded very successfully the destructions of the ekistic wealth in greece during wwii doxiadis became convinced that human settlements are subjectable to systematic investigation doxiadis being aware of the unifying power of systems thinking and particularly of the biological and evolutionary reference models as used by many famous biologists-philosophers of his generation especially sir julian huxley  1887 1975  theodosius dobzhansky  1900 75  dennis gabor  1900 79  ren  dubos  1901 82  george g simpson  1902 84  and conrad waddington  1905 75  used the biological model to describe the  ekistic behavior  of anthropos  the five principles  and the evolutionary model to explain the morphogenesis of human settlements  the eleven forces the hierarchical structure of human settlements dynapolis ecumenopolis  finally he formulated a general theory which considers human settlements as living organisms capable of evolution an evolution that might be guided by man using  ekistic knowledge 
ekistic units
doxiadis believed that the conclusion from biological and social experience was clear  to avoid chaos we must organize our system of life from anthropos  individual  to ecumenopolis  global city  in hierarchical levels represented by human settlements so he articulated a general hierarchical scale with fifteen levels of ekistic units 
names of units and population scale  final version from cadoxiadis  last book action for human settlements p 186 athens center of ekistics 1976   note  the population figures below are for doxiadis  ideal future ekistic units for the year 2100 at which time he estimated  in 1968  that earth would achieve zero population growth at a population of 50,000,000,000 with human civilization being powered by fusion energy
in comparison the united nations population estimate for the year 2100 at a constant growth rate uganda would form a small eperopolis with a population of about 1 billion people in an area of about 250,000 km   4600 people km  comparable to greater tokyo today 
details of the study of human settlement
one of the primary tenets of ekistics is the development of human settlements based on hexagonal infrastructures rectilinear urban planning is shown to fail miserably in the ability to efficiently handle the various zones  residential commercial and industrial  in ways that support people that are collectively and demonstrably well and fit  integrated and balanced spirit mind and body  that the horrendous traffic in such places as los angeles exist as a result of this type of  methodology  or more aptly phrased a lack of foresight and control in urban design is testament to the inability of rectilinear planning to adequately provide the means to effectively handle the growth of metropolitan settlements noded and hierarchical hexagons  think of a structured bi-directional tree or map in computer science a more geometric neural network or the refinement  not the baroque adornment  of the academie des beaux-arts d architecture evolved into a hexagonal infrastructure  or weighted hexagons and connected based on their proximity  think of a circulatory system  relative importance to the central function of the settlement eg a commercial center or an industrial sector or  neural center   if you will  and flow of human bodies or material resources not only provides for free-flowing circulation but enables the expansion and promotion of hexagonal sectors to higher weights of arrangement as the settlements increases in population and or importance it is important to remember though that the ekistical planning and development of human settlements based on such a scientific approach need not be considered a conversion into a collective machine rather ekistics provides the means by which individual settlements based on their ethnic background and geographic location to incorporate their heritage while arranging it in a manner that supports their collective intent literally much of the wasted time and resources can be significantly reduced so that the duty of the individual can be smoothly performed in order to allow ample time for the creative quality-of-life  story-telling the arts - martial applied and fine - cultivation of one s relationship with nature relaxation time and conversation etc  to emerge by means of the interpersonal relationships within and between settlement s  essentially the structure of ekistics enables humans to synergize their cultural heritage with technological evolution
