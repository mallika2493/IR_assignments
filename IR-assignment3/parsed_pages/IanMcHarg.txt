biography
formative years
his father was a local minister in the industrial city of glasgow scotland mcharg showed an early talent for drawing and was advised to consider a career in landscape architecture his early experiences with the bifurcated landscapes of scotland the smoky industrial urbanism of glasgow and the sublimity of the surrounding environs had a profound influence on his later thinking
it was not until after his term in the parachute regiment serving in war-stricken italy during world war ii however that he was able to explore the field of urban landscape architecture after working with the royal engineers during world war ii he travelled to america he was admitted to the school of architecture at harvard university s graduate school of design where he received professional degrees in both landscape architecture and city planning in 1949 after completing his education he returned to his homeland intending to help rebuild a country ravaged by war in scotland he worked on housing and programs in  new towns  until he was contacted by dean g holmes perkins from the university of pennsylvania dean perkins wanted mcharg to build a new graduate program in landscape architecture at the university
soon thereafter mcharg began teaching at the university of pennsylvania where he developed the department of landscape architecture and developed a popular new course titled man and environment in 1957 the course featured leading scholars whom mcharg invited to his class to discuss ethics and values as well as other ideas ranging from entropy to plate tectonics in 1960 he hosted his own television show on cbs the house we live in inviting prominent theologians and scientists of the day to discuss the human place in the world in a style similar to the one he honed teaching  man and environment 
in 1963 ian mcharg and david a wallace his academic colleague from the university of pennsylvania founded the firm of wallace and mcharg associates later wallace mcharg roberts   todd  wmrt  which is known for its central role in the development of the american environmental planning and urbanism movements the seminal work of the firm includes the plan for baltimore s inner harbor the plan for the valleys in baltimore county md and the plan for lower manhattan in new york city from 1963 through 1965
as the first-wave american environmental movement swept across american college campuses in the 1960s and early 1970s mcharg became an important figure linking a compelling personal presence and a powerful rhetoric with a direct and persuasive proposal for a new integration of human and natural environments through the 1960s and 1970s his course was the most popular on the penn campus and he was often invited to speak on campuses throughout the country
design with nature
in 1969 he published design with nature which was essentially a book of step-by-step instructions on how to break down a region into its appropriate uses mcharg also was interested in garden design and believed that homes should be planned and designed with good private garden space he promoted an ecological view in which the designer becomes very familiar with the area through analysis of soil climate hydrology etc design with nature was the first work of its kind  to define the problems of modern development and present a methodology or process prescribing compatible solutions  the book also affected a variety of fields and ideas frederick r steiner tells us that  environmental impact assessment new community development coastal zone management brownfields restoration zoo design river corridor planning and ideas about sustainability and regenerative design all display the influence of design with nature 
design with nature had its roots in much earlier landscape architecture philosophies it was sharply critical of the french baroque style of garden design which mcharg saw as a subjugation of nature and full of praise for the english picturesque style of garden design mcharg s focus however was only partially on the visual and sensual qualities which had dominated the english picturesque movement instead he saw the earlier tradition as a precursor of his philosophy which was rooted less in aristocratic estate design or even garden design and more broadly in an ecological sensibility that accepted the interwoven worlds of the human and the natural and sought to more fully and intelligently design human environments in concert with the conditions of setting climate and environment always a polemicist mcharg set his thinking in radical opposition to what he argued was the arrogant and destructive heritage of urban-industrial modernity a style he described as  dominate and destroy 
following the publication of design with nature wallace mcharg roberts   todd  wmrt  worked in major american cities   minneapolis denver miami new orleans and washington  dc    and created environmentally-based master plans for amelia island plantation and sanibel islands in florida
later career
in 1971 mcharg delivered a speech at the north american wildlife and natural resources conference in portland oregon called  man  planetary disease  in the speech he asserted that due to the views of man and nature that have infiltrated all of western culture we are not guaranteed survival of man mcharg said  he treats the world as a storehouse existing for his delectation  he plunders rapes poisons and kills this living system the biosphere in ignorance of its workings and its fundamental value   to this end man is a  planetary disease  who has lived with no regard for nature he discusses how in the judeo-christian traditions the bible says that man is to have dominion over the earth mcharg says that for man to survive this idea must be taken as an allegory only and not as literally true lest this statement be construed as anti-religion he cites paul tillich  protestantism  gustav weigel  catholicism  and abram heschel  judaism  as noted religious scholars who are also in agreement with him on this point
ian mcharg was the original co-designer of the woodlands texas an unincorporated community in montgomery county texas this community was developed from timberland located thirty miles north of houston by george p mitchell who hired mcharg to consult on the project and as a result the original plans featured many of his unique designs due in part to concerns of flooding mcharg identified the water system as the most critical aspect of the site the natural drainage system the firm designed was successful at limiting the runoff with which mcharg was concerned and was also much cheaper than a conventional drainage system would have been in 1998 in his collection to heal the earth mcharg wrote that the woodlands is one of the best examples of his ideals most of the actual work was done by a large team while mcharg was still there and by many others in the years since he left the woodlands continues to be a successful ecological community even today
mcharg s own plans for urban expansion projects also were more  english  than  french  in their geometry he favoured what became known as  cluster development  with relatively dense housing set in a larger natural environment
in 1975 wmrt began the planning phase of a project for the shah of iran an environmental park to be called pardisan unlike any the world had ever seen the park was to demonstrate the heritage of the iranian people as well as to illustrate the major ecosystems of the world mcharg was enthusiastic about this project and greatly invested in the work the other partners of the firm however believed the project to be a significant risk despite the fact that iran was wealthy from the sale of oil their concerns became justified when the shah was overthrown and the firm was left with a large amount of debt from the project located at north west of tehran pardisan was later constructed after the islamic revolution
