epistemology
in north america community studies drew inspiration from the classic urban sociology texts produced by the chicago school such as the works of louis wirth and william foote whyte in britain community studies was developed for colonial administrators working in east africa particularly kenya it was further developed in the post-war period with the institute of community studies founded by michael young in east london and with the studies published from the institute such as family and kinship in east london
community studies like colonial anthropology have often assumed the existence of discrete relatively homogeneous almost tribe-like communities which can be studied as organic wholes in this it has been a key influence on communitarianism and communalism from the local context to the global and everywhere in between

another focus of curricula in community studies is upon anthropology cultural anthropology in particular some programs set as prerequisite knowledge the background and historical contexts for community drawing upon archeological findings and the theoretical underpinnings for social organization in ancient and prehistorical community settings the theories connected with the so-called  neolithic revolution  is one example of a deep study into how where and why hunter-gatherer communities formed
