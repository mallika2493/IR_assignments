green revolution - wikipedia
the green revolution refers to a set of research and development of technology transfer initiatives occurring between the 1930s and the late 1960s  with prequels in the work of the agrarian geneticist nazareno strampelli in the 1920s and 1930s  that increased agricultural production worldwide particularly in the developing world beginning most markedly in the late 1960s the initiatives resulted in the adoption of new technologies including 
the initiatives led by norman borlaug the  father of the green revolution  who received the nobel peace prize in 1970 credited with saving over a billion people from starvation involved the development of high-yielding varieties of cereal grains expansion of irrigation infrastructure modernization of management techniques distribution of hybridized seeds synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to farmers
the term  green revolution  was first used in 1968 by former us agency for international development  usaid  director william gaud who noted the spread of the new technologies   these and other developments in the field of agriculture contain the makings of a new revolution it is not a violent red revolution like that of the soviets nor is it a white revolution like that of the shah of iran i call it the green revolution 


history
green revolution in mexico
it has been argued that  during the twentieth century two  revolutions  transformed rural mexico  the mexican revolution  1910-1920  and the green revolution  1950-1970  with the support of the mexican government the us government the united nations the food and agriculture organization  fao  and the rockefeller foundation mexico made a concerted effort to transform agricultural productivity particularly with irrigated rather than dry-land cultivation in its northwest to solve its problem of lack of food self-sufficiency in the center and south of mexico where large-scale production faced challenges agricultural production languished increased production meant food self-sufficiency in mexico to feed its growing and urbanizing population with the number of calories consumed per mexican increasing technology was seen as a valuable way to feed the poor and would relieve some pressure of the land redistribution process
mexico was not merely the recipient of green revolution knowledge and technology but was an active participant with financial support from the government for agriculture as well as mexican agronomists  agr nomos  although the mexican revolution had broken the back of the hacienda system and land reform in mexico had by 1940 distributed a large expanse of land in central and southern mexico agricultural productivity had fallen during the administration of manuel avila camacho  1940 46  the government put resources into developing new breeds of plants and partnered with the rockefeller foundation in 1943 the mexican government founded the international maize and wheat improvement center  cimmyt  which became a base for international agricultural research
agriculture in mexico had been a sociopolitical issue a key factor in some regions  participation in the mexican revolution it was also a technical issue which the development of a cohort trained agronomists who were to advise peasants how to increase productivity in the post-world war ii era the government sought development in agriculture that bettered technological aspects of agriculture in regions that were not dominated by small-scale peasant cultivators this drive for transforming agriculture would have the benefit of keeping mexico self-sufficient in food and in the political sphere with the cold war potentially stem unrest and the appeal of communism technical aid can be seen as also serving political ends in the international sphere in mexico it also served political ends separating peasant agriculture based on the ejido and considered one of the victories of the mexican revolution from agribusiness that requires large-scale land ownership irrigation specialized seeds fertilizers and pesticides machinery and a low-wage paid labor force
the government created the mexican agricultural program  map  to be the lead organization in raising productivity one of their successes was wheat production with varieties the agency s scientists helped create dominating wheat production as early as 1951  70   1965  80   and 1968  90   mexico became the showcase for extending the green revolution to other areas of latin america and beyond into africa and asia new breeds of maize beans along with wheat produced bumper crops with proper inputs  such as fertilizer and pesticides  and careful cultivation many mexican farmers who had been dubious about the scientists or hostile to them  often a mutual relationship of discord  came to see the scientific approach to agriculture worth adopting
green revolution in rice  ir8 and the philippines
in 1960 the government of the republic of the philippines with the ford foundation and the rockefeller foundation established irri  international rice research institute  a rice crossing between dee-geo-woo-gen and peta was done at irri in 1962 in 1966 one of the breeding lines became a new cultivar ir8 ir8 required the use of fertilizers and pesticides but produced substantially higher yields than the traditional cultivars annual rice production in the philippines increased from 3.7 to 7.7 million tons in two decades the switch to ir8 rice made the philippines a rice exporter for the first time in the 20th century
green revolution s start in india
in 1961 india was on the brink of mass famine norman borlaug was invited to india by the adviser to the indian minister of agriculture c subramaniam despite bureaucratic hurdles imposed by india s grain monopolies the ford foundation and indian government collaborated to import wheat seed from the international maize and wheat improvement center  cimmyt  punjab was selected by the indian government to be the first site to try the new crops because of its reliable water supply and a history of agricultural success india began its own green revolution program of plant breeding irrigation development and financing of agrochemicals
india soon adopted ir8   a semi-dwarf rice variety developed by the international rice research institute  irri  that could produce more grains of rice per plant when grown with certain fertilizers and irrigation in 1968 indian agronomist sk de datta published his findings that ir8 rice yielded about 5 tons per hectare with no fertilizer and almost 10 tons per hectare under optimal conditions this was 10 times the yield of traditional rice ir8 was a success throughout asia and dubbed the  miracle rice  ir8 was also developed into semi-dwarf ir36
in the 1960s rice yields in india were about two tons per hectare  by the mid-1990s they had risen to six tons per hectare in the 1970s rice cost about  550 a ton  in 2001 it cost under  200 a ton india became one of the world s most successful rice producers and is now a major rice exporter shipping nearly 4.5 million tons in 2006
consultative group on international agricultural research - cgiar
in 1970 foundation officials proposed a worldwide network of agricultural research centers under a permanent secretariat this was further supported and developed by the world bank  on 19 may 1971 the consultative group on international agricultural research cgiar  was established co-sponsored by the fao ifad and undp cgiar has added many research centers throughout the world
cgiar has responded at least in part to criticisms of green revolution methodologies this began in the 1980s and mainly was a result of pressure from donor organizations methods like agroecosystem analysis and farming system research have been adopted to gain a more holistic view of agriculture
brazil s agricultural revolution
brazil s vast inland cerrado region was regarded as unfit for farming before the 1960s because the soil was too acidic and poor in nutrients according to norman borlaug however from the 1960s vast quantities of lime  pulverised chalk or limestone  were poured on the soil to reduce acidity the effort went on for decades  by late 1990s between 14 million and 16 million tonnes of lime were being spread on brazilian fields each year the quantity rose to 25 million tonnes in 2003 and 2004 equalling around five tonnes of lime per hectare as a result brazil has become the world s second biggest soybean exporter soybeans are also widely used in animal feed and the large volume of soy produced in brazil has contributed to brazil s rise to become the biggest exporter of beef and poultry in the world several parallels can also be found in argentina s boom in soybean production as well
problems in africa
there have been numerous attempts to introduce the successful concepts from the mexican and indian projects into africa these programs have generally been less successful reasons cited include widespread corruption insecurity a lack of infrastructure and a general lack of will on the part of the governments yet environmental factors such as the availability of water for irrigation the high diversity in slope and soil types in one given area are also reasons why the green revolution is not so successful in africa
a recent program in western africa is attempting to introduce a new high-yielding  family  of rice varieties known as  new rice for africa   nerica  nerica varieties yield about 30  more rice under normal conditions and can double yields with small amounts of fertilizer and very basic irrigation however the program has been beset by problems getting the rice into the hands of farmers and to date the only success has been in guinea where it currently accounts for 16  of rice cultivation
after a famine in 2001 and years of chronic hunger and poverty in 2005 the small african country of malawi launched the  agricultural input subsidy program  by which vouchers are given to smallholder farmers to buy subsidized nitrogen fertilizer and maize seeds within its first year the program was reported to have had extreme success producing the largest maize harvest of the country s history enough to feed the country with tons of maize left over the program has advanced yearly ever since various sources claim that the program has been an unusual success hailing it as a  miracle 
agricultural production and food security
technologies
the green revolution spread technologies that already existed but had not been widely implemented outside industrialized nations these technologies included modern irrigation projects pesticides synthetic nitrogen fertilizer and improved crop varieties developed through the conventional science-based methods available at the time
the novel technological development of the green revolution was the production of novel wheat cultivars agronomists bred cultivars of maize wheat and rice that are generally referred to as hyvs or  high-yielding varieties  hyvs have higher nitrogen-absorbing potential than other varieties since cereals that absorbed extra nitrogen would typically lodge or fall over before harvest semi-dwarfing genes were bred into their genomes a japanese dwarf wheat cultivar  norin 10 wheat  which was sent to washington dc by cecil salmon was instrumental in developing green revolution wheat cultivars ir8 the first widely implemented hyv rice to be developed by irri was created through a cross between an indonesian variety named  peta  and a chinese variety named  dee-geo-woo-gen 
with advances in molecular genetics the mutant genes responsible for arabidopsis thaliana genes  ga 20-oxidase ga1 ga1-3  wheat reduced-height genes  rht  and a rice semidwarf gene  sd1  were cloned these were identified as gibberellin biosynthesis genes or cellular signaling component genes stem growth in the mutant background is significantly reduced leading to the dwarf phenotype photosynthetic investment in the stem is reduced dramatically as the shorter plants are inherently more stable mechanically assimilates become redirected to grain production amplifying in particular the effect of chemical fertilizers on commercial yield
hyvs significantly outperform traditional varieties in the presence of adequate irrigation pesticides and fertilizers in the absence of these inputs traditional varieties may outperform hyvs therefore several authors have challenged the apparent superiority of hyvs not only compared to the traditional varieties alone but by contrasting the monocultural system associated with hyvs with the polycultural system associated with traditional ones
production increases
cereal production more than doubled in developing nations between the years 1961 1985 yields of rice maize and wheat increased steadily during that period the production increases can be attributed roughly equally to irrigation fertilizer and seed development at least in the case of asian rice
while agricultural output increased as a result of the green revolution the energy input to produce a crop has increased faster so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time green revolution techniques also heavily rely on chemical fertilizers pesticides and herbicides and rely on machines which as of 2014 rely on or are derived from crude oil making agriculture increasingly reliant on crude oil extraction proponents of the peak oil theory fear that a future decline in oil and gas production would lead to a decline in food production or even a malthusian catastrophe
effects on food security
the effects of the green revolution on global food security are difficult to assess because of the complexities involved in food systems
the world population has grown by about four billion since the beginning of the green revolution and many believe that without the revolution there would have been greater famine and malnutrition india saw annual wheat production rise from 10 million tons in the 1960s to 73 million in 2006 the average person in the developing world consumes roughly 25  more calories per day now than before the green revolution between 1950 and 1984 as the green revolution transformed agriculture around the globe world grain production increased by about 160 
the production increases fostered by the green revolution are often credited with having helped to avoid widespread famine and for feeding billions of people
there are also claims that the green revolution has decreased food security for a large number of people one claim involves the shift of subsistence-oriented cropland to cropland oriented towards production of grain for export or animal feed for example the green revolution replaced much of the land used for pulses that fed indian peasants for wheat which did not make up a large portion of the peasant diet
criticism
3rd world economic sovereignty
a main criticism of the effects of the green revolution is the rising costs for many small farmers using hyv seeds with their associated demands of increased irrigation systems and pesticides a case study is found in india where farmers are planting cotton seeds capable of producing bt toxin a criticism regarding the green revolution are the effects regarding the widespread commercialization and market share of organisations particularly of the phasing out of seed saving practices in favor of purchasing of seeds and concerns regarding the financial affordability of the adoption of patented crops amongst farmers particularly of those in the developing world this can allow larger farms even foreign owned farming operations to buy up local smallhold farms
vandana shiva notes that this is the  second green revolution  the first green revolution she notes was mostly publicly-funded  by the indian government  this new green revolution she says is driven by private  interest - notably mncs like monsanto ultimately this is leading to foreign ownership over most of india s farmland
food security
some criticisms generally involve some variation of the malthusian principle of population such concerns often revolve around the idea that the green revolution is unsustainable and argue that humanity is now in a state of overpopulation or overshoot with regards to the sustainable carrying capacity and ecological demands on the earth
although 36 million people die each year as a direct or indirect result of hunger and poor nutrition malthus s more extreme predictions have frequently failed to materialize in 1798 thomas malthus made his prediction of impending famine the world s population had doubled by 1923 and doubled again by 1973 without fulfilling malthus s prediction malthusian paul r ehrlich in his 1968 book the population bomb said that  india couldn t possibly feed two hundred million more people by 1980  and  hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs  ehrlich s warnings failed to materialize when india became self-sustaining in cereal production in 1974  six years later  as a result of the introduction of norman borlaug s dwarf wheat varieties
since supplies of oil and gas are essential to modern agriculture techniques a fall in global oil supplies could cause spiking food prices in the coming decades
to some modern western sociologists and writers increasing food production is not synonymous with increasing food security and is only part of a larger equation for example harvard professor amartya sen claimed large historic famines were not caused by decreases in food supply but by socioeconomic dynamics and a failure of public action however economist peter bowbrick disputes sen s theory arguing that sen relies on inconsistent arguments and contradicts available information including sources that sen himself cited bowbrick further argues that sen s views coincide with that of the bengal government at the time of the bengal famine of 1943 and the policies sen advocates failed to relieve the famine
some have challenged the value of the increased food production of green revolution agriculture miguel a altieri  a pioneer of agroecology and peasant-advocate  writes that the comparison between traditional systems of agriculture and green revolution agriculture has been unfair because green revolution agriculture produces monocultures of cereal grains while traditional agriculture usually incorporates polycultures
these monoculture crops are often used for export feed for animals or conversion into biofuel according to emile frison of bioversity international the green revolution has also led to a change in dietary habits as fewer people are affected by hunger and die from starvation but many are affected by malnutrition such as iron or vitamin-a deficiencies frison further asserts that almost 60  of yearly deaths of children under age five in developing countries are related to malnutrition
high-yield rice  hyr  introduced since 1964 to poverty-ridden asian countries such as the philippines was found to have inferior flavor and be more glutinous and less savory than their native varieties this caused its price to be lower than the average market value
in the philippines the introduction of heavy pesticides to rice production in the early part of the green revolution poisoned and killed off fish and weedy green vegetables that traditionally coexisted in rice paddies these were nutritious food sources for many poor filipino farmers prior to the introduction of pesticides further impacting the diets of locals
a major critic of the green revolution us investigative journalist mark dowie writes 
citing internal foundation documents dowie states that the ford foundation had a greater concern than rockefeller in this area
there is significant evidence that the green revolution weakened socialist movements in many nations in countries such as india mexico and the philippines technological solutions were sought as an alternative to expanding agrarian reform initiatives the latter of which were often linked to socialist politics
socioeconomic impacts
the transition from traditional agriculture in which inputs were generated on-farm to green revolution agriculture which required the purchase of inputs led to the widespread establishment of rural credit institutions smaller farmers often went into debt which in many cases results in a loss of their farmland the increased level of mechanization on larger farms made possible by the green revolution removed a large source of employment from the rural economy because wealthier farmers had better access to credit and land the green revolution increased class disparities with the rich poor gap widening as a result because some regions were able to adopt green revolution agriculture more readily than others  for political or geographical reasons  interregional economic disparities increased as well many small farmers are hurt by the dropping prices resulting from increased production overall however large-scale farming companies only account for less than 10  of the total farming capacity this is a criticism held by many small producers in the food sovereignty movement
the new economic difficulties of small holder farmers and landless farm workers led to increased rural-urban migration the increase in food production led to a cheaper food for urban dwellers and the increase in urban population increased the potential for industrialization
globalization
in the most basic sense the green revolution was a product of globalization as evidenced in the creation of international agricultural research centers that shared information and with transnational funding from groups like the rockefeller foundation ford foundation and united states agency for international development  usaid 
environmental impact
the spread of green revolution agriculture affected both agricultural biodiversity  or agrodiversity  and wild biodiversity there is little disagreement that the green revolution acted to reduce agricultural biodiversity as it relied on just a few high-yield varieties of each crop
this has led to concerns about the susceptibility of a food supply to pathogens that cannot be controlled by agrochemicals as well as the permanent loss of many valuable genetic traits bred into traditional varieties over thousands of years to address these concerns massive seed banks such as consultative group on international agricultural research s  cgiar  international plant genetic resources institute  now bioversity international  have been established  see svalbard global seed vault 
there are varying opinions about the effect of the green revolution on wild biodiversity one hypothesis speculates that by increasing production per unit of land area agriculture will not need to expand into new uncultivated areas to feed a growing human population however land degradation and soil nutrients depletion have forced farmers to clear up formerly forested areas in order to keep up with production a counter-hypothesis speculates that biodiversity was sacrificed because traditional systems of agriculture that were displaced sometimes incorporated practices to preserve wild biodiversity and because the green revolution expanded agricultural development into new areas where it was once unprofitable or too arid for example the development of wheat varieties tolerant to acid soil conditions with high aluminium content permitted the introduction of agriculture in sensitive brazilian ecosystems such as cerrado semi-humid tropical savanna and amazon rainforest in the geoeconomic macroregions of centro-sul and amaz nia before the green revolution other brazilian ecosystems were also significantly damaged by human activity such as the once 1st or 2nd main contributor to brazilian megadiversity atlantic rainforest  above 85  of deforestation in the 1980s about 95  after the 2010s  and the important xeric shrublands called caatinga mainly in northeastern brazil  about 40  in the 1980s about 50  after the 2010s   deforestation of the caatinga biome is generally associated with greater risks of desertification  this also caused many animal species to suffer due to their damaged habitats
nevertheless the world community has clearly acknowledged the negative aspects of agricultural expansion as the 1992 rio treaty signed by 189 nations has generated numerous national biodiversity action plans which assign significant biodiversity loss to agriculture s expansion into new domains
the green revolution has been criticized for an agricultural model which relied on a few staple and market profitable crops and pursing a model which limited the biodiversity of mexico one of the critics against these techniques and the green revolution as a whole was carl o sauer a geography professor at the university of california berkeley according to sauer these techniques of plant breeding would result in negative effects on the country s resources and the culture 
 a good aggressive bunch of american agronomists and plant breeders could ruin the native resources for good and all by pushing their american commercial stocks  and mexican agriculture cannot be pointed toward standardization on a few commercial types without upsetting native economy and culture hopelessly unless the americans understand that they d better keep out of this country entirely that must be approached from an appreciation of native economies as being basically sound 
according to a study published in 2013 in pnas in the absence of the crop germplasm improvement associated with the green revolution greenhouse gas emissions would have been 5.2-7.4 gt higher than observed in 1965 2004 high yield agriculture has dramatics affects on the amount of carbon cycling in the atmosphere the way in which farms are grown in tandem with the seasonal carbon cycling of various crops could alter the impact carbon in the atmosphere has on global warming wheat rice and soybean crops account for a significant amount of the increase n carbon in the atmosphere over the last 50 years
most high intensity agricultural production is highly reliant on non-renewable resources agricultural machinery and transport as well as the production of pesticides and nitrates all depend on fossil fuels moreover the essential mineral nutrient phosphorus is often a limiting factor in crop cultivation while phosphorus mines are rapidly being depleted worldwide the failure to depart from these non-sustainable agricultural production methods could potentially lead to a large scale collapse of the current system of intensive food production within this century
health impact
the consumption of the pesticides used to kill pests by humans in some cases may be increasing the likelihood of cancer in some of the rural villages using them poor farming practices including non-compliance to usage of masks and over-usage of the chemicals compound this situation in 1989 who and unep estimated that there were around 1 million human pesticide poisonings annually some 20,000  mostly in developing countries  ended in death as a result of poor labeling loose safety standards etc
long term exposure to pesticides such as organochlorines creosote and sulfate have been correlated with higher cancer rates and organochlorines ddt chlordane and lindane as tumor promoters in animals contradictory epidemiologic studies in humans have linked phenoxy acid herbicides or contaminants in them with soft tissue sarcoma  sts  and malignant lymphoma organochlorine insecticides with sts non-hodgkin s lymphoma  nhl  leukemia and less consistently with cancers of the lung and breast organophosphorous compounds with nhl and leukemia and triazine herbicides with ovarian cancer
the indian state of punjab pioneered green revolution among the other states transforming india into a food-surplus country the state is witnessing serious consequences of intensive farming using chemicals and pesticide a comprehensive study conducted by post graduate institute of medical education and research  pgimer  has underlined the direct relationship between indiscriminate use of these chemicals and increased incidence of cancer in this region an increase in the number of cancer cases has been reported in several villages including jhariwala koharwala puckka bhimawali and khara
environmental activist vandana shiva has written extensively about the social political and economic impacts of the green revolution in punjab she claims that the green revolution s reliance on heavy use of chemical inputs and monocultures has resulted in water scarcity vulnerability to pests and incidents of violent conflict and social marginalization
in 2009 under a greenpeace research laboratories investigation dr reyes tirado from the university of exeter uk conducted the study in 50 villages in muktsar bathinda and ludhiana districts revealed chemical radiation and biological toxicity rampant in punjab twenty percent of the sampled wells showed nitrate levels above the safety limit of 50 mg l established by who the study connected it with high use of synthetic nitrogen fertilizers
norman borlaug s response to criticism
borlaug dismissed certain claims of critics but also cautioned  there are no miracles in agricultural production nor is there such a thing as a miracle variety of wheat rice or maize which can serve as an elixir to cure all ills of a stagnant traditional agriculture 
of environmental lobbyists he said 
however the charge of  elitism  could also be leveled against supporters of the green revolution as noted in the documentary profits from poison protective gear for farmers is often designed by people who have never experienced tropical climates for example plastic ponchos create a sauna effect if worn in high temperature humidity as opposed the experience of wearing them in an airconditioned office
the new green revolution
although the green revolution has been able to improve agricultural output in some regions in the world there was and is still room for improvement as a result many organizations continue to invent new ways to improve the techniques already used in the green revolution frequently quoted inventions are the system of rice intensification marker-assisted selection agroecology and applying existing technologies to agricultural problems of the developing world
