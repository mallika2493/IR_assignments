meaning
the term  eminent domain  was taken from the legal treatise de jure belli et pacis written by the dutch jurist hugo grotius in 1625 which used the term dominium eminens  latin for supreme lordship  and described the power as follows 
the exercise of eminent domain is not limited to real property governments may also take personal property governments can even acquire intangible property such as contract rights patents trade secrets and copyrights even the taking of professional sports team s franchise has been held by the california supreme court to be within the purview of the  public use  constitutional limitation although eventually that taking was not permitted because it was deemed to violate the interstate commerce clause of the us constitution
a taking of property must be accompanied by payment of  just compensation  to the  owner in theory this is supposed to put the owner in the same position  pecuniarily  that he would have been in had his property not been taken but in practice courts have limited compensation to the property s fair market value considering its highest and best use but though rarely granted this is not the exclusive measure of compensation  see united states v kimball laundry  business losses in temporary takings  and united states v pewee coal co  operating losses cause by government operations of a mine seized during world war ii  in most takings the owner is not compensated for a variety of incidental losses caused by the taking of his or her property that though incurred and readily demonstrable are deemed by the courts to be noncompensable the same is true of attorneys  and appraisers fees but as a matter of legislative grace rather than constitutional requirement some of these losses  eg business goodwill  have been made compensable by state legislative enactments and may be partially covered by provisions of the federal uniform relocation assistance act

united states
most states use the term eminent domain but some us states use the term appropriation  new york  or expropriation  louisiana  as synonyms for the exercise of eminent domain powers the term condemnation is used to describe the formal act of exercising this power to transfer title or some lesser interest in the subject property where this happens such as when an easement or a leasehold is taken the condemnor must pay just compensation the same as in total takings
the constitutionally required  just compensation  is usually measured by fair market value of the part taken plus severance damages  the diminution in value of the property remaining to the owner  when only a part of the subject property is taken where a partial taking provides economic benefits specific to the remainder those must be deducted typically from severance damages
the practice of condemnation came to the american colonies with the common law when it came time to draft the united states constitution differing views on eminent domain were voiced the fifth amendment added to the constitution as part of the bill of rights requires that the taking be for a  public use  and mandating payment of  just compensation  to the owner
the legislature may take private property directly  without recourse to the courts  by passing an act transferring title of the subject property directly to the government the property owner may then seek compensation by suing for compensation in the us court of federal claims the legislature may also delegate the power to private entities like public utilities or railroads and even to individuals the us supreme court has consistently deferred to the right of states to make their own determinations of  public use

england and wales
after his victory in 1066 william the conqueror seized virtually all land in england although he maintained absolute power over the land he granted fiefs to landholders who served as stewards paying fees and providing military services during the hundred years war in the 14th century edward iii used the crown s right of purveyance for massive expropriations chapter 28 of magna carta required that immediate cash payment be made for expropriations as the king s power was broken down in the ensuing centuries tenants were regarded as holding ownership rights rather than merely possessory rights over their land in 1427 a statute was passed granting commissioners of sewers in lincolnshire the power to take land without compensation after the early 16th century however parliamentary takings of land for roads bridges etc generally did require compensation the common practice was to pay 10  more than the assessed value however as the voting franchise was expanded to include more non-landowners the bonus was eliminated in spite of contrary statements found in some american law in the united kingdom compulsory purchase valuation cases were tried to juries well into the 20th century dekeyser s royal hotel v the king  1919

australia
in australia section 51 xxxi  of the australian constitution permits the commonwealth parliament to make laws with respect to  the acquisition of property on just terms from any state or person for any purpose in respect of which the parliament has power to make laws  this has been construed as meaning that just compensation may not always include monetary or proprietary recompense rather it is for the court to determine what is just it may be necessary to imply a need for compensation in the interests of justice lest the law be invalidated
property subject to resumption is not restricted to real estate as authority from the federal court has extended the states  power to resume property to any form of physical property for the purposes of section 51 xxxi  money is not property that may be compulsorily acquired a statutory right to sue has been considered  property  under this section
the commonwealth must also derive some benefit from the property acquired that is the commonwealth can  only legislate for the acquisition of property for particular purposes  accordingly the power does not extend to allow legislation designed merely to seek to extinguish the previous owner s title the states and territories  powers of resumption on the other hand are not so limited the section 43 1  of the lands acquisition act 1998  nt  grants the minister the power to acquire land  for any purpose whatever  the high court of australia interpreted this provision literally relieving the territory government of any public purpose limitation on the power this finding permitted the territory government to acquire land subject to native title effectively extinguishing the native title interest in the land kirby j in dissent along with a number of commentators viewed this as a missed opportunity to comment on the exceptional nature of powers of resumption exercised in the absence of a public purpose limitation
the term resumption is a reflection of the fact that as a matter of australian law all land was originally owned by the crown before it was sold leased or granted and that through the act of compulsory acquisition the crown is  resuming  possession

other countries
many countries recognize eminent domain to a much lesser extent than the english-speaking world or do not recognize it at all japan for instance has very weak eminent domain powers as evidenced by the high-profile opposition to the expansion of narita international airport and the disproportionately large amounts of financial inducement given to residents on sites slated for redevelopment in return for their agreement to leave one well-known recent case being that of roppongi hills
there are other countries such as the people s republic of china that practice eminent domain whenever it is convenient to make space for new communities and government structures singapore practices eminent domain under the land acquisitions act which allows it to carry out its selective en bloc redevelopment scheme for urban renewal the amendments to the land titles act allowed property to be purchased for purposes of urban renewal against an owner sharing a collective title if the majority of the other owners wish to sell and the minority did not thus eminent domain often invokes concerns of majoritarianism
