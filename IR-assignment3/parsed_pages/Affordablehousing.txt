affordable housing - wikipedia
affordable housing is housing deemed affordable to those with a median household income as rated by country state  province  region or municipality by a recognized housing affordability index in australia the national affordable housing summit group developed their definition of affordable housing as housing that is  reasonably adequate in standard and location for lower or middle income households and does not cost so much that a household is unlikely to be able to meet other basic needs on a sustainable basis  in the united kingdom affordable housing includes  social rented and intermediate housing provided to specified eligible households whose needs are not met by the market  most of the literature on affordable housing refers to mortgages and number of forms that exist along a continuum   from emergency shelters to transitional housing to non-market rental  also known as social or subsidized housing  to formal and informal rental indigenous housing and ending with affordable home ownership
the notion of housing affordability became widespread in the 1980s in europe and north america in the words of alain bertaud of new york university and former principal planner at the world bank
housing choice is a response to an extremely complex set of economic social and psychological impulses for example some households may choose to spend more on housing because they feel they can afford to while others may not have a choice 

measuring housing affordability
median multiple
the median multiple indicator recommended by the world bank and the united nations rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by gross  annual median household income 
determining housing affordability is complex and the commonly used housing-expenditure-to-income-ratio tool has been challenged in the united states and canada a commonly accepted guideline for housing affordability is a housing cost that does not exceed 30  of a household s gross income canada for example switched to a 25  rule from a 20  rule in the 1950s in the 1980s this was replaced by a 30  rule india uses a 40  rule
housing affordability index  hai 
one of the greatest strengths of the hai developed by mit is its ability to capture the total cost of ownership of individuals  housing choices in computing the index the obvious cost of rents and mortgage payments are modified by the hidden costs of those choices
household income and wealth
income is the primary factor  not price and availability that determines housing affordability in a market economy the distribution of income is the key determinant of the quantity and quality of housing obtained therefore understanding affordable housing challenges requires understanding trends and disparities in income and wealth housing is often the single biggest expenditure of low and middle income families for low and middle income families their house is also the greatest source of wealth
the most common approach to measure the affordability of housing has been to consider the percentage of income that a household spends on housing expenditures another method of studying affordability looks at the regular hourly wage of full-time workers who are paid only the minimum wage  as set by their local regional or national government  the hope is that full-time workers will be able to afford at least a small apartment in the area where they work some countries look at those living in relative poverty which is usually defined as making less than 60  of the median household income in their policy reports they consider the presence or absence of housing for people making 60  of the median income
housing expenditures
housing affordability can be measured by the changing relationships between house prices and rents and between house prices and incomes there has been an increase among policy makers in affordable housing as the price of housing has increased dramatically creating a crisis in affordable housing
since 2000 the  world experienced an unprecedented house price boom in terms of magnitude and duration but also of synchronisation across countries   never before had house prices risen so fast for so long in so many countries  prices doubled in many countries and nearly tripled in ireland
the bursting of the biggest financial bubble in history in 2008 wreaked havoc globally on the housing market by 2011 home prices in ireland had plunged by 45  from their peak in 2007 in the united states prices fell by 34  while foreclosures increased exponentially in spain and denmark home prices dropped by 15  however in spite of the bust home prices continue to be overvalued by about 25  or more in australia belgium canada france new zealand britain the netherlands spain and sweden
causes and consequences of rise in house prices
costs are being driven by a number of factors including 
a number of researchers  david rodda jacob vigdor janna matlack and jacob vigdor  argue that a shortage of affordable housing   at least in the us   is caused in part by income inequality david rodda noted that from 1984 and 1991 the number of quality rental units decreased as the demand for higher quality housing increased  rhoda 1994 148  through gentrification of older neighbourhoods for example in east new york rental prices increased rapidly as landlords found new residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing and left lower income families without rental units the ad valorem property tax policy combined with rising prices made it difficult or impossible for low income residents to keep pace
other housing expenditures
in measuring affordability of housing there are various expenditures beyond the price of the actual housing stock itself that are considered depending on the index being used
some organizations and agencies consider the cost of purchasing a single-family home  others look exclusively at the cost of renting an apartment
many us studies for example focus primarily on the median cost of renting a two-bedroom apartment in a large apartment complex for a new tenant these studies often lump together luxury apartments and slums as well as desirable and undesirable neighborhoods while this practice is known to distort the true costs it is difficult to provide accurate information for the wide variety of situations without the report being unwieldy
normally only legal permitted separate housing is considered when calculating the cost of housing the low rent costs for a room in a single family home or an illegal garage conversion or a college dormitory are generally excluded from the calculation no matter how many people in an area live in such situations because of this study methodology median housing costs tend to be slightly inflated
costs are generally considered on a cash  not accrual  basis thus a person making the last payment on a large home mortgage might live in officially unaffordable housing one month and very affordable housing the following month when the mortgage is paid off this distortion can be significant in areas where real estate costs are high even if incomes are similarly high because a high income allows a higher proportion of the income to be dedicated towards buying an expensive home without endangering the household s ability to buy food or other basic necessities
growing density convergence and regional urbanization
the majority of the more than seven billion people on earth now live in cities  un  there are more than 500 city regions of more than one million inhabitants in the world cities become megacities become megalopolitan city regions and even  galaxies  of more than 60 million inhabitants the yangtze delta-greater shanghai region now surpasses 80 million tokyo-yokohoma adjacent to osaka-kobe-kyoto have a combined population of 100 million rapid population growth leads to increased need for affordable housing in most cities
the availability of affordable housing in proximity of mass transit and linked to job distribution has become severely imbalanced in this period of rapid regional urbanization and growing density convergence
 in addition to the distress it causes families who cannot find a place to live lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community s overall health 
affordable housing challenges in inner cities range from the homeless who are forced to live on the street to the relative deprivation of vital workers like police officers firefighters teachers and nurses unable to find affordable accommodation near their place of work these workers are forced to live in suburbia commuting up to two hours each way to work lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labour scarcer  as workers travel longer distances   pollard and stanley 2007 
economy
lack of affordable housing places a particular burden on local economies
as well individual consumers are faced with mortgage arrears and excessive debt and therefore cut back on consumption a combination of high housing costs and high debt levels contributes to a reduction in savings
these factors can lead to decreased investment in sectors that are essential to the long-term growth of the economy
supply and demand
in some countries the market has been unable to meet the growing demand to supply housing stock at affordable prices although demand for affordable housing particularly rental housing that is affordable for low and middle income earners has increased the supply has not potential home buyers are forced to turn to the rental market which is also under pressure an inadequate supply of housing stock increases demand on the private and social rented sector and in worse case scenarios homelessness
some of the factors that affect the supply and demand of housing stock
factors that affect tenure choices  ex owner occupier private rented social rented 
labour market performance
in both large metropolitan areas and regional towns where housing prices are high a lack of affordable housing places local firms at a competitive disadvantage they are placed under wage pressures as they attempt to decrease the income housing price gap key workers have fewer housing choices if prices rise to non-affordable levels variations in affordability of housing between areas may create labour market impediments
potential workers are discouraged from moving to employment in areas of low affordability they are also discouraged from migrating to areas of high affordability as the low house prices and rents indicate low capital gain potential and poor employment prospects
social costs of lack of affordable housing
housing affordability is more than just a personal trouble experienced by individual households who cannot easily find a place to live lack of affordable housing is considered by many urban planners to have negative effects on a community s overall health
jobs transportation and affordable housing
lack of affordable housing can make low-cost labor more scarce and increase demands on transportation systems  as workers travel longer distances between jobs and affordable housing  housing cost increases in us cities have been linked to declines in enrollment at local schools
 faced with few affordable options many people attempt to find less expensive housing by buying or renting farther out but long commutes often result in higher transportation costs that erase any savings on shelter  pollard  2010  called this the  drive  til you qualify  approach which causes far-flung development and forces people to drive longer distances to get to work to get groceries to take children to school or to engage in other activities a well located dwelling might save significant household travel costs and therefore improve overall family economics even if the rent is higher than a dwelling in a poorer location a household s inhabitants must decide whether to pay more for housing to keep commuting time and expense low or to accept a long or expensive commute to obtain  better  housing the absolute availability of housing is not generally considered in the calculation of affordable housing in a depressed or sparsely settled rural area for example the predicted price of the canonical median two-bedroom apartment may be quite easily affordable even to a minimum-wage worker   if only any apartments had ever been built some affordable housing prototypes include nano house and affordable green tiny house project
affordable housing and public policy
policy makers at all levels   global national regional municipal community associations   are attempting to respond to the issue of affordable housing a highly complex crisis of global proportions with a myriad of policy instruments these responses range from stop-gap financing tools to long-term intergovernmental infrastructural changes
in the simplest of terms affordability of housing refers to the amount of capital one has available in relation to the price of the goods to be obtained public policies are informed by underlying assumptions about the nature of housing itself is housing a basic need a right an entitlement or a public good  or is just another household-level consumer choice a commodity or an investment within the free market system   housing policies provide a remarkable litmus test for the values of politicians at every level of office and of the varied communities that influence them often this test measures simply the warmth or coldness of heart of the more affluent and secure towards families of a lower socio-economic status  bacher 1993 16  
affordable housing needs can be addressed through public policy instruments that focus on the demand side of the market programs that help households reach financial benchmarks that make housing affordable this can include approaches that simply promote economic growth in general in the hope that a stronger economy higher employment rates and higher wages will increase the ability of households to acquire housing at market prices federal government policies define banking and mortgage lending practices tax and regulatory measures affecting building materials professional practices  ex real estate transactions  the purchasing power of individual households can be enhanced through tax and fiscal policies that result in reducing the cost of mortgages and the cost of borrowing public policies may include the implementation of subsidy programs and incentive patterns for average households for the most vulnerable groups such as seniors single-parent families the disabled etc some form of publicly funded allowance strategy can be implemented providing individual households with adequate income to afford housing
currently policies that facilitate production on the supply side include favorable land use policies such as inclusionary zoning relaxation of environmental regulations and the enforcement of affordable housing quotas in new developments
in some countries such as canada municipal governments began to play a greater role in developing and implementing policies regarding form and density of municipal housing in residential districts as early as the 1950s at the municipal level recently promoted policy tools include relaxation of prohibitions against accessory dwelling units and reduction of the amount of parking that must be built for a new structure
affordable housing is a controversial reality of contemporary life for gains in affordability often result from expanding land available for housing or increasing the density of housing units in a given area ensuring a steady supply of affordable housing means ensuring that communities weigh real and perceived livability impacts against the sheer necessity of affordability the process of weighing the impacts of locating affordable housing is quite contentious and is laden with race and class implications recent research however suggests that proximity to low-income housing developments generally has a positive impact on neighborhood property conditions
the growing gap between rich and poor since the 1980s manifests itself in a housing system where public policy decisions privilege the ownership sector to the disadvantage of the rental sector
right to build
an article in the november 2007 issue of atlantic monthly reported on a study of the cost of obtaining the  right to build   ie a building permit red tape bureaucracy etc  in different us cities the  right to build  cost does not include the cost of the land or the cost of constructing the house the study was conducted by harvard economists edward glaeser and kristina tobio according to the chart accompanying the article the cost of obtaining the  right to build  adds approximately  600,000 to the cost of each new house that is built in san francisco
government restrictions on affordable housing
many governments put restrictions on the size or cost of a dwelling that people can live in making it essentially illegal to live permanently in a house that is too small low cost or not meeting to other government defined requirements generally these laws are implemented in an attempt to raise the perceived  standard  of housing across the country this can lead to thousands of houses across a country being left empty for much of the year even when there is a great need for more affordable housing such as is the case in countries like sweden norway finland and denmark where there is a common tradition to have a summer house this sometimes raises concerns for the respect of rights such as the right to utilize one s property

canada
in canada affordability is one of three elements  adequacy suitability  used to determine core housing needs
in 2002 the social housing services corporation  shsc  was created by province of ontario to provide group services for social housing providers  public non-profit and co-op housing  following the downloading of responsibility for over 270,000 social housing units to local municipalities it is a non-profit corporation governed by a board of municipal non-profit and co-op housing representatives its mandate is to provide ontario housing providers and service managers with bulk purchasing insurance investment and information services that add significant value to their operations

recently there has been a move toward the integration of affordable social housing with market housing and other uses such as the 2006 10 redevelopment of the woodward s building site in vancouver
legislation to help make home ownership accessible to middle-class families and other measures aimed to make sure that british columbians can continue to live work and raise families in british columbia such as increasing rental property supply was passed and will take effect 0n august 2 2016
china
china is also experiencing a gap between housing price and affordability as it moves away from an in-kind welfare benefit system to a market-oriented allocation system  hui et al 2007  most urban housing prior to 1978 in the planned-economy era consisted of nearly free dwellings produced and allocated by the unsustainable single-channel state-funded system the goal of china s housing reform started in 1978 was to gradually transform housing from a  free good  to a  subsidized good  and eventually to a  commodity  the price of which reflects true production costs and a market profit margin in 1998 china accelerated its urban housing reform further moving away from an in-kind welfare benefit system to a market-oriented allocation system with the state reducing its role in housing provision the reform is followed by increasing home ownership housing consumption real estate investment as well as skyrocketing housing price
high housing price is a major issue in a number of big cities in china started in 2005 high housing appreciation rate became serious affordability problem for middle and low income families  in 2004 the housing appreciation rate of 17.8  almost twice the income growth rate 10   nbsc 2011  municipal governments have responded to the calling for increase housing supply to middle and low-income families by a number of policies and housing programs among which are the affordable housing program and the housing provident fund program
the affordable housing program  commonly known as the  economical and comfortable housing program or        is designed to provide affordable housing to middle- to low-income households to encourage home ownership in 1998 the department of construction and ministry of finance jointly promulgated  the method of urban affordable housing construction managing  marked the start of the program aimed at middle- to low-income households  annual income less than 30,000 to 70,000 rmb according to size of household and the specific area  this public housing program provides housing  usually 60 110 square meters  at affordable price  usually 50 70  market price 
within the policies and mandates set by the central government local governments are responsible for the operation of the program local governments usually appropriate state-owned land to real estate developers who are responsible for the finance and construction of affordable housing the profit for real estate developers are controlled to be less than 3  so as to keep the price of housing at the affordable level individuals need to apply for the affordable housing through household and income investigation
the program is controversial in recent years because of insufficient construction poor administration and widespread corruption local government has limited incentive to provide affordable housing as it means lower revenue from land-transferring fees and lower local gdp as a result the funding of the program has been decreasing ever from its inception and the affordable housing construction rate dropped from 15.6   1997  to 5.2   2008  because of the limited supply of affordable housing and excessive housing demand from the middle- to low-income populations affordable housing are usually sold at high market price in many cities ineligible high-income households own affordable housing units whereas many qualified families are denied access
housing provident fund  hpf  program is another policy effort to provide affordable housing china introduced the housing provident fund  hpf  program nationwide in 1995 it is similar to housing fund programs in other countries such as thailand and singapore hpf provides a mechanism allowing potential purchasers who have an income to save for and eventually purchase a unit dwelling  which may be a formerly public housing unit  the hpf includes a subsidized savings program linked to a retirement account subsidized mortgage rates and price discounts for housing purchase
india
in india it is estimated that in 2009 10 approximately 32  of the population was living below the poverty line and there is huge demand for affordable housing the deficit in urban housing is estimated at 18 million units most of which are amongst the economically weaker sections of the society some developers are developing low cost and affordable housing for this population the government of india has taken up various initiatives for developing properties in low cost and affordable segment they have also looked at ppp model for development of these properties  government of haryana  launch its affordable housing policy in 2013 this policy is intended to encourage the planning and completion of  group housing projects  wherein apartments of  pre-defined size  are made available at  pre-defined rates  within a  targeted time-frame  as prescribed under the present policy to ensure increased supply of  affordable housing  in the urban areas of haryana view haryana affordable housing policy 
united kingdom
the british housing market in the late 1980s and early 1990s experienced an almost unprecedented set of changes and pressures a combination of circumstances produced the crisis including changes in demography income distribution housing supply and tenure but financial deregulation was particularly important housing affordability became a significant policy issue when the impact on the normal functioning of the owner occupied market became severe and when macro-economic feedback effects were perceived as serious a number of specific policy changes resulted from this crisis some of which may endure many of these revolve around the ability or otherwise of people to afford housing whether as would-be buyers priced out of the boom recent buyers losing their home through mortgage default or trapped by  negative equity  or tenants affected by deregulation and much higher rent levels
a 2013 investigation by the bureau of investigative journalism found that the uk spent  1.88bn   enough to build 72,000 homes in london   on renting temporary accommodation in 12 of britain s biggest cities over the preceding four years
the united kingdom has a long tradition of promoting affordable social rented housing this may be owned by local councils or housing associations there are also a range of affordable home ownership options including shared ownership  where a tenant rents part share in the property from a social landlord and owns the remainder  the government has also attempted to promote the supply of owner occupied affordable stock for purchase principally by using the land-use planning system to require that housing developers provide a proportion of lower cost housing within new developments this approach is commonly known as inclusionary zoning  though not in the uk  and the current mechanism for securing the provision of affordable housing as part of a planning application for new housing development is through the use of a s.106 agreement in scotland the equivalent is a section 75 planning agreement  section 75 of the town and country planning  scotland  act 1997 
a high proportion of homes in the uk were previously council-owned but the numbers have been reduced since the early 1980s due to initiatives of the thatcher government that restricted council housing construction and provided financial and policy support to other forms social housing in 1980 the conservative government of margaret thatcher introduced the right to buy scheme offering council tenants the opportunity to purchase their housing at a discount of up to 60   70  on leasehold homes such as flats  alongside right to buy council-owned stock was further diminished as properties were transferred to housing associations council tenants in some instances have chosen to transfer management of the properties to arms-length non-profit organisations the tenants still remained council tenants and the housing stock still remained the property of the council this change in management was encouraged by extra funding from central government to invest in the housing stock under the decent homes programme the program required council housing to be brought up to a set standard was combined with restrictions on the amounts that councils could borrow and led to an increase in such arms length management organisations being set up in some areas significant numbers of council houses were demolished as part of urban regeneration programmes due to the poor quality of stock low levels of demand and social problems
in rural areas where local wages are low and house prices are higher  especially in regions with holiday homes  there are special problems planning restrictions severely limit rural development but if there is evidence of need then exception sites can be used for people with a local connection this evidence is normally provided by a housing needs survey carried out by a rural housing enabler working for the local rural community council
housing associations are not-for-profit organisations with a history that goes back before the start of the 20th century the number of homes under their ownership grew significantly from the 1980s as successive governments sought to make them the principal form of social housing in preference to local authorities many of the homes previously under the ownership of local authorities have been transferred to newly established housing associations including some of the largest in the country despite being not-for-profit organisations housing association rents are typically higher than for council housing renting a home through a housing association can in some circumstances prove costlier than purchasing a similar property through a mortgage
all major housing associations are registered with the homes and communities agency who are responsible for the regulation of social housing from 1 april 2012 housing associations that are registered were known as registered social landlords from 1996 but in the housing and regeneration act 2008 the official term became registered providers the latter also covers council housing and developers and other bodies that may receive grants for development 3 the department for communities and local government sets the policy for housing in england in scotland policy is set by the scottish parliament  inspecting and regulating activities falls to the scottish housing regulator social housing in northern ireland is regulated by the northern ireland housing executive which was established to take on ownership of former council stock and prevent sectarian allocation of housing to people from one religion
united states
the federal government in the us provides subsidies to make housing more affordable financial assistance is provided for homeowners through the mortgage interest tax deduction and for lower income households through housing subsidy programs in the 1970s the federal government spent similar amounts on tax reductions for homeowners as it did on subsidies for low-income housing however by 2005 tax reductions had risen to  120 billion per year representing nearly 80 percent of all federal housing assistance the advisory panel on federal tax reform for president bush proposed reducing the home mortgage interest deduction in a 2005 report
housing assistance from the federal government for lower income households can be divided into three parts 
 project based  subsidies are also known by their section of the us housing act or the housing act of 1949 and include section 8 section 236 section 221 d  3  section 202 for elderly households section 515 for rural renters section 514 516 for farmworkers and section 811 for people with disabilities there are also housing subsidies through the section 8 program that are project based the united states department of housing and urban development  hud  and usda rural development administer these programs hud and usda rural development programs have ceased to produce large numbers of units since the 1980s since 1986 the low-income housing tax credit program has been the primary federal program to produce affordable units  however the housing produced in this program is less affordable than the former hud programs
one of the most unusual us public housing initiatives was the development of subsidized middle-class housing during the late new deal  1940 42  under the auspices of the mutual ownership defense housing division of the federal works agency under the direction of colonel lawrence westbrook these eight projects were purchased by the residents after the second world war and as of 2009 seven of the projects continue to operate as mutual housing corporations owned by their residents these projects are among the very few definitive success stories in the history of the us public housing effort
in the us households are commonly defined in terms of the amount of realized income they earn relative to the area median income or ami localized ami figures are calculated annually based on a survey of comparably sized households within geographic ranges known as metropolitan statistical areas as defined by the us office of management and budget for us housing subsidies households are categorized by federal law as follows 
some states and cities in the united states operate a variety of affordable housing programs including supportive housing programs transitional housing programs and rent subsidies as part of public assistance programs local and state governments can adapt these income limits when administering local affordable housing programs  however us federal programs must adhere to the definitions above for the section 8 voucher program the maximum household contribution to rent can be as high as 40  gross income
comprehensive data for the most affordable and least affordable places in the us is published each year by an affordable housing non-profit organization the national low income housing coalition the nlihc promotes a guideline of 30  of household income as the upper limit of affordability according to a 2012 national low income housing coalition report in every community across the united states  rents are unaffordable to full-time working people 
however by using an indicator such as the median multiple indicator which rates affordability of housing by dividing the median house price by gross  annual median household income  without considering the extreme disparities between the incomes of high-net-worth individual  hnwi  and those in the lower quintiles a distorted picture of real affordability is created using this indicator which rates housing affordability on a scale of 0 to 5 with categories 3 and under affordable in 2012 the united states overall market was considered 3  affordable 
since 1996 while incomes in the upper quintile increased incomes in the lower quintile households decreased creating negative outcomes in housing affordability 
before the real estate bubble of 2007 the median household paid  658 per month in total housing costs  census 2002  a total of 20  of households were deemed to be living in unaffordable housing  nine percent of all households are renters in unaffordable housing and eleven percent of all households are homeowners with high housing costs
in the 2000 us census the median homeowner with a mortgage  70  of homeowners and 48  of census respondents  spent  1,088 each month or 21.7  of household income on housing costs the median homeowner without a mortgage  30  of all homeowners  80  of elderly homeowners  and 20  of respondents  spent  295 per month or 10.5  of household income on housing costs renters in 2001  32  of respondents  spent  633 each month or 29  of household income on housing costs
governmental and quasi-governmental agencies that contribute to the work of ensuring the existence of a steady supply of affordable housing in the united states are the us department of housing and urban development  hud  usda rural development the federal home loan bank fannie mae and freddie mac housing partnership network is an umbrella organization of 100  housing and community development nonprofits important private sector institutions worth consulting are the national association of home builders the national affordable housing management association  nahma  the council for affordable and rural housing  carh  and the national association of realtors valuable research institutions with staff dedicated to the analysis of  affordable housing  includes  the center for housing policy brookings institution the urban institute and the joint center for housing studies at harvard university and the furman center for real estate and urban policy at new york university and the center on budget and policy priorities several of these institutions  the fannie mae foundation urban institute brookings institution metropolitan policy program enterprise community partners lisc the harvard joint center for housing studies and others  partnered to create knowledgeplex an online information resource devoted to affordable housing and community development issues

new york city suffers from a shortage of affordable housing new york city is a highly desirable place to live attracting thousands of new residents each year and faces water and public transportation constraints as a result housing prices continue to climb finding affordable housing in new york city is a struggle for a large portion of the city s population including low-income moderate-income and even median income families since 1970 income has remained stagnant while rent has nearly doubled for new yorkers consequently 48.7  of householders spend more than 30  of their income on rent several federal and state initiatives have targeted this problem but have failed to provide enough affordable inclusive and sustainable housing for new york city residents
new york city continues to be a racially and economically segregated city while the poverty rate for white-non hispanics is below the national average at 11.0  the poverty rate for minority groups is significantly higher the poverty rate for african americans is 20.8  and the poverty rate for asians is 18.1  the poverty rate for hispanics is the highest at 28.1  of the population historically public housing was assigned by race and ethnicity and neighborhoods in new york still remain segregated more than 60  of white-non hispanics live in areas characterized as having high access to economic opportunities with low transit accessibility in contrast more hispanics african americans and asians live in areas that are transit accessible but have low opportunity similarly most of the federally subsidized housing in new york city tends to be located in areas that are transit accessible but lack access to stable jobs and educational opportunities
sustainability is a large portion of what constitutes a neighborhood s overall feel sustainable housing characteristics include green building techniques that promote energy efficiency successful recycling practices and the walkability of a neighborhood affordable housing in new york city tends to be highly walkable with easy access to public transit however green building practices are eschewed in affordable housing with the belief that the upfront costs are too expensive
one of the primary characteristics of neighborhoods with concentrated affordable housing in new york city is a lack of access to economic opportunities the neighborhoods that have the highest concentration of public housing also fall into the category of the neighborhoods that have the lowest number of locally employed residents these neighborhoods fail to provide quality schools and stable jobs scholars have coined this idea as the  uneven geography of opportunity   residents of concentrated low- income communities are more likely to lead a life with poor outcomes including bad health unstable low wages and achieving below average levels of education.4 one of the primary causes of this is that these communities and residents are disconnected from the resources more affluent neighboring communities may have such as better schools and job opportunities
the issue of affordable housing concerns new yorkers as a community overall with more than 90  believing that everyone has a right to shelter with the recent recession and increasing housing costs it is not surprising that more than 30  of new york city residents fear they may one day be homeless
