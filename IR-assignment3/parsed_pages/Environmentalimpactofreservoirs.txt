environmental impact of reservoirs - wikipedia
the environmental impact of reservoirs comes under ever increasing scrutiny as the global demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases
dams and reservoirs can be used to supply drinking water generate hydroelectric power increase the water supply for irrigation provide recreational opportunities and flood control however adverse environmental and sociological impacts have been identified during and after many reservoir constructions whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental to either the environment or surrounding human populations has been debated since the 1960s and likely before then as well in 1960 the construction of llyn celyn and the flooding of capel celyn provoked political uproar which continues to this day more recently the construction of three gorges dam and other similar projects throughout asia africa and latin america have generated considerable environmental and political debate


upstream impacts
fragmentation of river ecosystems
a dam also acts as a barrier between the upstream and downstream movement of migratory river animals such as salmon and trout
some communities have also begun the practice of transporting migratory fish upstream to spawn via a barge
reservoir sedimentation
rivers carry sediment down their riverbeds allowing for the formation of depositional features such as river deltas alluvial fans braided rivers oxbow lakes levees and coastal shores the construction of a dam blocks the flow of sediment downstream leading to downstream erosion of these sedimentary depositional environments and increased sediment build-up in the reservoir while the rate of sedimentation varies for each dam and each river eventually all reservoirs develop a reduced water-storage capacity due to the exchange of storage space for sediment diminished storage capacity results in decreased ability to produce hydroelectric power reduced availability of water for irrigation and if left unaddressed may ultimately result in the expiration of the dam and river
impact below dam
riverline and coastal erosion
as all dams result in reduced sediment load downstream a dammed river is said to be  hungry  for sediment because the rate of deposition of sediment is greatly reduced since there is less to deposit but the rate of erosion remains nearly constant the water flow erodes the river shores and riverbed threatening shoreline ecosystems deepening the riverbed and narrowing the river over time this leads to a compromised water table reduced water levels homogenization of the river flow and thus reduced ecosystem variability reduced support for wildlife and reduced amount of sediment reaching coastal plains and deltas this prompts coastal erosion as beaches are unable to replenish what waves erode without the sediment deposition of supporting river systems downsteam channel erosion of dammed rivers is related to the morphology of the riverbed which is different from directly studying the amounts of sedimentation because it is subject to specific long term conditions for each river system for example the eroded channel could create a lower water table level in the affected area impacting bottomland crops such as alfalfa or corn and resulting in a smaller supply in the case of the three gorges dam in china the changes described above now appears to have arrived at a new balance of erosion and sedimentation over a 10-year period in the lower reaches of the river the impacts on the tidal region have also been linked to the upstream effects of the dam
water temperature
the water of a deep reservoir in temperate climates typically stratifies with a large volume of cold oxygen poor water in the hypolimnion analysis of temperature profiles from 11 large dams in the murray darling basin  australia  indicated differences between surface water and bottom water temperatures up to 16.7 degrees celsius if this water is released to maintain river flow it can cause adverse impacts on the downstream ecosystem including fish populations under worse case conditions  such as when the reservoir is full or near full  the stored water is strongly stratified and large volumes of water are being released to the downstream river channel via bottom level outlets depressed temperatures can be detected 250 - 350 kilometres downstream the operators of burrendong dam on the macquarie river  eastern australia  are attempting to address thermal suppression by hanging a geotextile curtain around the existing outlet tower to force the selective release of surface water 
effects beyond the reservoir
effects on humans
diseases
whilst reservoirs are helpful to humans they can also be harmful as well one negative effect is that the reservoirs can become breeding grounds for disease vectors this holds true especially in tropical areas where mosquitoes  which are vectors for malaria  and snails  which are vectors for schistosomiasis  can take advantage of this slow flowing water
resettlement
dams and the creation of reservoirs also require relocation of potentially large human populations if they are constructed close to residential areas the record for the largest population relocated belongs to the three gorges dam built in china its reservoir submerged a large area of land forcing over a million people to relocate  dam related relocation affects society in three ways  an economic disaster human trauma and social catastrophe  states dr michael cernea of the world bank and dr thayer scudder a professor at the california institute of technology as well as resettlement of communities care must also be taken not to irreparably damage sites of historical or cultural value the aswan dam forced the movement of the temple at aswan to prevent its destruction by the flooding of the reservoir
disaster
dams occasionally break causing catastrophic damage to communities downstream dams break due to engineering errors attack or natural disaster the greatest dam break disaster happened in china killing 200,000 chinese citizens however they have happened in california killing 600 people germany during world war ii and other countries
flood control
the controversial three gorges dam in china is able to store 22 cubic kilometres of floodwaters on the yangtze river the 1954 yangtze river floods killed 33,000 people and displaced 18 million people from their homes in 1998 a flood killed 4000 people and 180 million people were affected a flood in august 2009 was completely captured behind the new dam
effects on flood-dependent ecology and agriculture
in many developing countries the savanna and forest ecology of the floodplains depend on seasonal flooding from rivers also flood recession cropping is practiced extensively whereby the land is cultivated taking advantage of the residual soil moisture after floods recede dams attenuate floods which may affect the ecology and agriculture seriously
case studies
greenhouse gases
reservoirs may contribute to changes in the earth s climate warm climate reservoirs generate methane a greenhouse gas when the reservoirs are stratified in which the bottom layers are anoxic  ie they lack oxygen  leading to degradation of biomass through anaerobic processes at a dam in brazil where the flooded basin is wide and the biomass volume is high the methane produced results in a pollution potential 3.5 times more than an oil-fired power plant would be a theoretical study has indicated that globally hydroelectric reservoirs may emit 104 million metric tonnes of methane gas annually methane gas is a significant contributor to global climate change
the following table indicates reservoir emissions in milligrams per square meter per day for different bodies of water
