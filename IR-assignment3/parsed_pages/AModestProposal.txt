a modest proposal - wikipedia
a modest proposal for preventing the children of poor people from being a burthen to their parents or country and for making them beneficial to the publick commonly referred to as a modest proposal is a juvenalian satirical essay written and published anonymously by jonathan swift in 1729 swift suggests that the impoverished irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies this satirical hyperbole mocks heartless attitudes towards the poor as well as british policy toward the irish in general
in english writing the phrase  a modest proposal  is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire


details
swift goes to great lengths to support his argument including a list of possible preparation styles for the children and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion he uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential william petty and the social engineering popular among followers of francis bacon these lampoons include appealing to the authority of  a very knowing american of my acquaintance in london  and  the famous psalmanazar a native of the island formosa   who had already confessed to not being from formosa in 1706  this essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the english language much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in ireland so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of swift s solution when he states  a young healthy child well nursed is at a year old a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food whether stewed roasted baked or boiled  and i make no doubt that it will equally serve in a fricassee or a ragout 
in the tradition of roman satire swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by paralipsis 
population solutions
george wittkowsky argued that swift s main target in a modest proposal was not the conditions in ireland but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution a memorable example of these sorts of schemes  involved the idea of running the poor through a joint-stock company  in response swift s modest proposal was  a burlesque of projects concerning the poor  that were in vogue during the early 18th century
a modest proposal also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects the pamphlet targets reformers who  regard people as commodities  in the piece swift adopts the  technique of a political arithmetician  to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics
critics differ about swift s intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy edmund wilson argues that statistically  the logic of the  modest proposal  can be compared with defense of crime  arrogated to marx  in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population  wittkowsky counters that swift s satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that  springs from a spirit of bitter mockery not from the delight in calculations for their own sake 
rhetoric
charles k smith argues that swift s rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the irish swift s specific strategy is twofold using a  trap  to create sympathy for the irish and a dislike of the narrator who in the span of one sentence  details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty  but feels emotion solely for members of his own class swift s use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator s cool approach towards them create  two opposing points of view  that  alienate the reader perhaps unconsciously from a narrator who can view with  melancholy  detachment a subject that swift has directed us rhetorically to see in a much less detached way 
swift has his proposer further degrade the irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals lewis argues that the speaker uses  the vocabulary of animal husbandry  to describe the irish once the children have been commodified swift s rhetoric can easily turn  people into animals then meat and from meat logically into tonnage worth a price per pound 
swift uses the proposer s serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal in making his argument the speaker uses the conventional textbook-approved order of argument from swift s time  which was derived from the latin rhetorician quintilian  the contrast between the  careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme  and  the ridiculousness of the proposal  create a situation in which the reader has  to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent thoughtful and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan 
influences
scholars have speculated about which earlier works swift may have had in mind when he wrote a modest proposal
tertullian s apology
james johnson argued that a modest proposal was largely influenced and inspired by tertullian s apology  a satirical attack against early roman persecution of christianity james william johnson believes that swift saw major similarities between the two situations johnson notes swift s obvious affinity for tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works a modest proposal and apology in structure johnson points out the same central theme that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument that  human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human  stylistically swift and tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language in agreement with johnson donald c baker points out the similarity between both authors  tones and use of irony baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic  justification by ownership  over the subject of sacrificing children tertullian while attacking pagan parents and swift while attacking the english mistreatment of the irish poor
defoe s the generous projector
it has also been argued that a modest proposal was at least in part a response to the 1728 essay the generous projector or a friendly proposal to prevent murder and other enormous abuses by erecting an hospital for foundlings and bastard children by swift s rival daniel defoe
mandeville s modest defence of publick stews
bernard mandeville s modest defence of publick stews asked to introduce public and state controlled bordellos the 1726 paper acknowledges women s interests and   while not being a complete satirical text - has been discussed as well as an inspiration for jonatan swifts title mandeville had become famous with the fable of the bees and deliberations on private vices and public benefits in 1705 already
john locke from the first treatise of government
 be it then as sir robert says that anciently it was usual for men to sell and castrate their children let it be that they exposed them  add to it if you please for this is still greater power that they begat them for their tables to fat and eat them  if this proves a right to do so we may by the same argument justifie adultery incest and sodomy for there are examples of these too both ancient and modern  sins which i suppose have the principle aggravation from this that they cross the main intention of nature which willeth the increase of mankind and the continuation of the species in the highest perfection and the distinction of families with the security of the marriage bed as necessary thereunto   first treatise sec 59 
economic themes
robert phiddian s article  have you eaten yet  the reader in a modest proposal  focuses on two aspects of a modest proposal  the voice of swift and the voice of the proposer phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of jonathan swift and the apparent economic projections of the proposer he reminds readers that  there is a gap between the narrator s meaning and the text s and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody 
while swift s proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal george wittkowsky author of  swift s modest proposal  the biography of an early georgian pamphlet  argues that to understand the piece fully it is important to understand the economics of swift s time wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century england  f one regards the modest proposal simply as a criticism of condition about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that swift s irony brilliantly underscored this fact 
 people are the riches of a nation 
at the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century it was believed that  people are the riches of the nation  and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less furthermore  in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry  in those times the  somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity 
louis a landa presents swift s a modest proposal as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that  people are the riches of a nation  swift presents the dire state of ireland and shows that mere population itself in ireland s case did not always mean greater wealth and economy the uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer not richer swift also recognises the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox  the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens swift however landa argues is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that england was denying irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity
