rational planning model - wikipedia
the rational planning model is a model of the planning process involving a number of rational actions or steps taylor  1998  outlines five steps as follows 
the rational planning model is used in planning and designing neighborhoods cities and regions it has been central in the development of modern urban planning and transportation planning the model has many limitations particularly the lack of guidance on involving stakeholders and the community affected by planning and other models of planning such as collaborative planning are now also widely used
the very similar rational decision-making model as it is called in organizational behavior is a process for making logically sound decisions this multi-step model and aims to be logical and follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution rational decision making is a multi-step process for making logically sound decisions that aims to follow the orderly path from problem identification through solution


method
rational decision-making or planning follows a series of steps detailed below 
verify define and detail the problem
verifying defining   detailing the problem  problem definition goal definition information gathering  this step includes recognizing the problem defining an initial solution and starting primary analysis examples of this are creative devising creative ideas inspirations breakthroughs and brainstorms
the very first step which is normally overlooked by the top level management is defining the exact problem though we think that the problem identification is obvious many times it is not the rational decision making model is a group-based decision making process if the problem is not identified properly then we may face a problem as each and every member of the group might have a different definition of the problem hence it is very important that the definition of the problem is the same among all group members only then is it possible for the group members to find alternate sources or problem solving in an effective manner
generate all possible solutions
this step encloses two to three final solutions to the problem and preliminary implementation to the site in planning examples of this are planned units of development and downtown revitalizations
this activity is best done in groups as different people may contribute different ideas or alternative solutions to the problem without alternative solutions there is a chance of arriving at a non-optimal or a rational decision for exploring the alternatives it is necessary to gather information technology may help with gathering this information
generate objective assessment criteria
evaluative criteria are measurements to determine success and failure of alternatives this step contains secondary and final analysis along with secondary solutions to the problem examples of this are site suitability and site sensitivity analysis after going thoroughly through the process of defining the problem exploring for all the possible alternatives for that problem and gathering information this step says evaluate the information and the possible options to anticipate the consequences of each and every possible alternative that is thought of at this point optional criteria for measuring the success or failure of the decision taken needs to be considered
choose the best solution generated
this step comprises a final solution and secondary implementation to the site at this point the process has developed into different strategies of how to apply the solutions to the site
based on the criteria of assessment and the analysis done in previous steps choose the best solution generated these four steps form the core of the rational decision making model
implement the preferred alternative
this step includes final implementation to the site and preliminary monitoring of the outcome and results of the site this step is the building renovations part of the process
monitor and evaluate outcomes and results
this step contains the secondary and final monitoring of the outcomes and results of the site this step takes place over a long period of time
feedback
modify future decisions and actions taken based on the above evaluation of outcomes
discourse of rational planning model used in policy making
the rational model of decision-making is a process for making sound decisions in policy making in the public sector rationality is defined as  a style of behavior that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints  it is important to note the model makes a series of assumptions in order for it to work such as 
indeed some of the assumptions identified above are also pin pointed out in a study written by the historian ha drake as he states 
in its purest form the rational actor approach presumes that such a figure  has complete freedom of action to achieve goals that he or she has articulated through a careful process of rational analysis involving full and objective study of all pertinent information and alternatives at the same time it presumes that this central actor is so fully in control of the apparatus of government that a decision once made is as good as implemented there are no staffs on which to rely no constituencies to placate no generals or governors to cajole by attributing all decision making to one central figure who is always fully in control and who acts only after carefully weighing all options the rational actor method allows scholars to filter out extraneous details and focus attention on central issues
furthermore as we have seen in the context of policy rational models are intended to achieve maximum social gain for this purpose simon identifies an outline of a step by step mode of analysis to achieve rational decisions ian thomas describes simon s steps as follows 
in similar lines wiktorowicz and deber describe through their study on  regulating biotechnology  a rational-political model of policy development  the rational approach to policy development the main steps involved in making a rational decision for these authors are the following 
the approach of wiktorowicz and deber is similar to simon and they assert that the rational model tends to deal with  the facts   data probabilities  in steps 1 to 3 leaving the issue of assessing values to the final step according to wiktorowicz and deber values are introduced in the final step of the rational model where the utility of each policy option is assessed
many authors have attempted to interpret the above-mentioned steps amongst others patton and sawicki  who summarize the model as presented in the following figure  missing  
the model of rational decision-making has also proven to be very useful to several decision making processes in industries outside the public sphere nonetheless many criticism of the model arise due to claim of the model being impractical and lying on unrealistic assumptions for instance it is a difficult model to apply in the public sector because social problems can be very complex ill-defined and interdependent the problem lies in the thinking procedure implied by the model which is linear and can face difficulties in extra ordinary problems or social problems which have no sequences of happenings this latter argument can be best illustrated by the words of thomas r dye the president of the lincoln center for public service who wrote in his book  understanding public policy  the following passage 
there is no better illustration of the dilemmas of rational policy making in america than in the field of health the first obstacle to rationalism is defining the problem is our goal to have good health   that is whether we live at all  infant mortality  how well we live  days lost to sickness  and how long we live  life spans and adult mortality   or is our goal to have good medical care   frequent visits to the doctor wellequipped and accessible hospitals and equal access to medical care by rich and poor alike 
the problems faced when using the rational model arise in practice because social and environmental values can be difficult to quantify and forge consensus around furthermore the assumptions stated by simon are never fully valid in a real world context
however as thomas states the rational model provides a good perspective since in modern society rationality plays a central role and everything that is rational tends to be prized thus it does not seem strange that  we ought to be trying for rational decision-making 
decision criteria for policy analysis   step 2
as illustrated in figure 1 rational policy analysis can be broken into 6 distinct stages of analysis step 2 highlights the need to understand which factors should be considered as part of the decision making process at this part of the process all the economic social and environmental factors that are important to the policy decision need to be identified and then expressed as policy decision criteria for example the decision criteria used in the analysis of environmental policy is often a mix of  
some criteria such as economic benefit will be more easily measurable or definable while others such as environmental quality will be harder to measure or express quantitatively ultimately though the set of decision criteria needs to embody all of the policy goals and overemphasising the more easily definable or measurable criteria will have the undesirable impact of biasing the analysis towards a subset of the policy goals
the process of identifying a suitably comprehensive decision criteria set is also vulnerable to being skewed by pressures arising at the political interface for example decision makers may tend to give  more weight to policy impacts that are concentrated tangible certain and immediate than to impacts that are diffuse intangible uncertain and delayed  8 for example with a cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions the net financial cost in the first five years of policy implementation is a far easier impact to conceptualise than the more diffuse and uncertain impact of a country s improved position to influence global negotiations on climate change action
decision methods for policy analysis   step 5
displaying the impacts of policy alternatives can be done using a policy analysis matrix  pam  such that shown in table 1 as shown a pam provides a summary of the policy impacts for the various alternatives and examination of the matrix can reveal the tradeoffs associated with the different alternatives
table 1 policy analysis matrix  pam  for so2 emissions control
once policy alternatives have been evaluated the next step is to decide which policy alternative should be implemented this is shown as step 5 in figure 1 at one extreme comparing the policy alternatives can be relatively simple if all the policy goals can be measured using a single metric and given equal weighting in this case the decision method is an exercise in benefit cost analysis  bca 
at the other extreme the numerous goals will require the policy impacts to be expressed using a variety of metrics that are not readily comparable in such cases the policy analyst may draw on the concept of utility to aggregate the various goals into a single score with the utility concept each impact is given a weighting such that 1 unit of each weighted impact is considered to be equally valuable  or desirable  with regards to the collective well-being
weimer and vining also suggest that the  go no go  rule can be a useful method for deciding amongst policy alternatives 8 under this decision making regime some or all policy impacts can be assigned thresholds which are used to eliminate at least some of the policy alternatives in their example one criterion  is to minimize so2 emissions  and so a threshold might be a reduction so2 emissions  of at least 8.0 million tons per year  as such any policy alternative that does not meet this threshold can be removed from consideration if only a single policy alternative satisfies all the impact thresholds then it is the one that is considered a  go  for each impact otherwise it might be that all but a few policy alternatives are eliminated and those that remain need to be more closely examined in terms of their trade-offs so that a decision can be made
case study example of rational policy analysis approach
to demonstrate the rational analysis process as described above let s examine the policy paper  stimulating the use of biofuels in the european union  implications for climate change policy  by lisa ryan where the substitution of fossil fuels with biofuels has been proposed in the european union  eu  between 2005 2010 as part of a strategy to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions from road transport increase security of energy supply and support development of rural communities
considering the steps of patton and sawicki model as in figure 1 above this paper only follows components 1 to 5 of the rationalist policy analysis model 
requirements and limitations
however there are a lot of assumptions requirements without which the rational decision model is a failure therefore they all have to be considered the model assumes that we have or should or can obtain adequate information both in terms of quality quantity and accuracy this applies to the situation as well as the alternative technical situations it further assumes that you have or should or can obtain substantive knowledge of the cause and effect relationships relevant to the evaluation of the alternatives in other words it assumes that you have a thorough knowledge of all the alternatives and the consequences of the alternatives chosen it further assumes that you can rank the alternatives and choose the best of it the following are the limitations for the rational decision making model 
current status
while the rational planning model was innovative at its conception the concepts are controversial and questionable processes today the rational planning model has fallen out of mass use as of the last decade rather than conceptualising human agents as rational planners lucy suchman argues agents can better be understood as engaging in situated action going further guy benveniste argued that the rational model could not be implemented without taking the political context into account
