mumford s earliest books in the field of literary criticism have had a lasting impact on contemporary american literary criticism the golden day contributed to a resurgence in scholarly research on the work of 1850s american transcendentalist authors and herman melville  a study of his life and vision effectively launched a revival in the study of the work of herman melville soon after with the book the brown decades he began to establish himself as an authority in american architecture and urban life which he interpreted in a social context
in his early writings on urban life mumford was optimistic about human abilities and wrote that the human race would use electricity and mass communication to build a better world for all humankind he would later take a more pessimistic stance his early architectural criticism also helped to bring wider public recognition to the work of henry hobson richardson louis sullivan and frank lloyd wright

ideas
in his book the condition of man published in 1944 mumford characterized his orientation toward the study of humanity as  organic humanism  the term is an important one because it sets limits on human possibilities limits that are aligned with the nature of the human body mumford never forgot the importance of air quality of food availability of the quality of water or the comfort of spaces because all these things had to be respected if people were to thrive technology and progress could never become a runaway train in his reasoning so long as organic humanism was there to act as a brake indeed mumford considered the human brain from this perspective characterizing it as hyperactive a good thing in that it allowed humanity to conquer many of nature s threats but potentially a bad thing if it were not occupied in ways that stimulated it meaningfully mumford s respect for human  nature  that is to say the natural characteristics of being human provided him with a platform from which to assess technologies and technics in general thus his criticism and counsel with respect to the city and with respect to the implementation of technology was fundamentally organized around the organic humanism to which he ascribed it was from the perspective of organic humanism that mumford eventually launched a critical assessment of marshall mcluhan who argued that the technology not the natural environment would ultimately shape the nature of humankind a possibility that mumford recognized but only as a nightmare scenario
mumford believed that what defined humanity what set human beings apart from other animals was not primarily our use of tools  technology  but our use of language  symbols  he was convinced that the sharing of information and ideas amongst participants of primitive societies was completely natural to early humanity and had obviously been the foundation of society as it became more sophisticated and complex he had hopes for a continuation of this process of information  pooling  in the world as humanity moved into the future
mumford s choice of the word  technics  throughout his work was deliberate for mumford technology is one part of technics using the broader definition of the greek tekhne which means not only technology but also art skill and dexterity technics refers to the interplay of social milieu and technological innovation the  wishes habits ideas goals  as well as  industrial processes  of a society as mumford writes at the beginning of technics and civilization  other civilizations reached a high degree of technical proficiency without apparently being profoundly influenced by the methods and aims of technics 
megatechnics
in the myth of the machine vol ii  the pentagon of power  chapter 12   1970  mumford criticizes the modern trend of technology which emphasizes constant unrestricted expansion production and replacement he contends that these goals work against technical perfection durability social efficiency and overall human satisfaction modern technology which he called  megatechnics  fails to produce lasting quality products by using devices such as consumer credit installment buying non-functioning and defective designs planned obsolescence and frequent superficial  fashion  changes  without constant enticement by advertising  he writes  production would slow down and level off to normal replacement demand otherwise many products could reach a plateau of efficient design which would call for only minimal changes from year to year 
he uses his own refrigerator as an example reporting that it  has been in service for nineteen years with only a single minor repair  an admirable job both automatic refrigerators for daily use and deepfreeze preservation are inventions of permanent value ne can hardly doubt that if biotechnic criteria were heeded rather than those of market analysts and fashion experts an equally good product might come forth from detroit with an equally long prospect of continued use 
biotechnics
mumford was deeply concerned with the relationship between technics and bioviability the latter term not used by mumford characterizes an area s capability to support life up through its levels of complexity before the advent of technology most areas of the planet were bioviable at some level or other  however where certain forms of technology advance rapidly bioviability decreases dramatically slag heaps poisoned waters parking lots and concrete cities for example are extremely limited in terms of their bioviability illustrated in the somewhat startling 1943 novel title a tree grows in brooklyn and non-bioviable regions are common to cinema in the form of dystopias  eg bladerunner  mumford did not believe it was necessary for bioviability to collapse as technics advanced however because he held it was possible to create technologies that functioned in an ecologically responsible manner and he called that sort of technology biotechnics mumford believed that biotechnic consciousness  and possibly even community  was emerging as a later stage in the evolution of darwinian thinking about the nature of human life he believed this was the sort of technics needed to shake off the suicidal drive of  megatechnics  while mumford recognized an ecological consciousness that traces back to the earliest communities he regarded emerging biotechnics as a product of neo-darwinian consciousness as a post-industrial form of thinking one that refuses to look away from the mutually-influencing relationship between the state of the living organism and the state of its environment in mumford s mind the society organized around biotechnics would restrain its technology for the sake of that integral relationship
in mumford s understanding the various technologies that arose in the megatechnic context have brought unintended and harmful side effects along with the obvious benefits they have bequeathed to us he points out for example that the development of money  as a technology  created as a side effect a context for irrational accumulation of excess because it eliminated the burdensome aspects of object-wealth by making wealth abstract in those eras when wealth was not abstract plenitude had functioned as the organizing principle around its acquisition  ie wealth measured in grains lands animals to the point that one is satisfied but not saddled with it  money which allows wealth to be conceived as pure quantity instead of quality is an example of megatechnics one which can spiral out of control if mumford is right in this conceptualization historians and economists should be able to trace a relationship between the still-increasing abstraction of wealth and radical transformations with respect to wealth s distribution and role and indeed it does appear that alongside its many benefits the movement toward electronic money has stimulated forms of economic stress and exploitation not yet fully understood and not yet come to their conclusion a technology for distributing resources that was less given to abstract hoarding would be more suitable to a biotechnic conception of living
thus mumford argued that the biotechnic society would not hold to the megatechnic delusion that technology must expand unceasingly magnifying its own power and would shatter that delusion in order to create and preserve  livability  rather than the megatechnic pursuit of power the biotechnic society would pursue what mumford calls  plenitude   that is a homeostatic relationship between resources and needs this notion of plenitude becomes clearer if we suggest that the biotechnic society would relate to its technology in the manner an animal relates to available food under circumstances of natural satisfaction the pursuit of technological advance would not simply continue  for its own sake 
alongside the limiting effect of satisfaction amidst plenitude the pursuit of technological advance would also be limited by its potentially negative effects upon the organism thus in a biotechnic society the quality of air the quality of food the quality of water these would all be significant concerns that could limit any technological ambitions threatening to them the anticipated negative value of noise radiation smog noxious chemicals and other technical by-products would significantly constrain the introduction of new technical innovation in mumford s words a biotechnic society would direct itself toward  qualitative richness amplitude spaciousness and freedom from quantitative pressures and crowding self-regulation self-correction and self-propulsion are as much an integral property of organisms as nutrition reproduction growth and repair  the biotechnic society would pursue balance wholeness and completeness  and this is what those individuals in pursuit of biotechnics would do as well
mumford s critique of the city and his vision of cities that are organized around the nature of human bodies so essential to all mumford s work on city life and urban design is rooted in an incipient notion of biotechnics   livability  a notion which mumford got from his mentor patrick geddes
mumford used the term biotechnics in the later sections of the pentagon of power written in 1970 the term sits well alongside his early characterization of  organic humanism  in that biotechnics represent the concrete form of technique that appeals to an organic humanist when mumford described biotechnics automotive and industrial pollution had become dominant technological concerns along with the fear of nuclear annihilation mumford recognized however that technology had even earlier produced a plethora of hazards and that it would do so into the future for mumford human hazards are rooted in a power-oriented technology that does not adequately respect and accommodate the essential nature of humanity effectively mumford is stating as others would later state explicitly that contemporary human life understood in its ecological sense is out of balance because the technical parts of its ecology  guns bombs cars drugs  have spiralled out of control driven by forces peculiar to them rather than constrained by the needs of the species that created them he believed that biotechnics was the emerging answer then the only hope that could be set out against the problem of megatechnics an answer that he believed was already beginning to assert itself in his time
it is true that mumford s writing privileges the term  biotechnics  more than the  biotechnic society  the reason is clear in the last sentence of the pentagon of power where he writes  for those of us who have thrown off the myth of the machine the next move is ours  for the gates of the technocratic prison will open automatically despite their rusty ancient hinges as soon as we choose to walk out  mumford believed that the biotechnic society was a desideratum one that should guide his contemporaries as they walked out the doors of their megatechnic confines  he also calls them  coffins   thus he ends his narrative as he well understood at the beginning of another one  the possible revolution that gives rise to a biotechnic society a quiet revolution for mumford one that would arise from the biotechnic consciousness and actions of individuals mumford was an avid reader of alfred north whitehead s philosophy of the organism
polytechnics versus monotechnics
a key idea introduced in technics and civilization  1934  was that technology was twofold 
mumford commonly criticized modern america s transportation networks as being  monotechnic  in their reliance on cars automobiles become obstacles for other modes of transportation such as walking bicycle and public transit because the roads they use consume so much space and are such a danger to people mumford explains that the thousands of maimed and dead each year as a result of automobile accidents are a  ritual sacrifice  the american society makes because of its extreme reliance on highway transport
three epochs of civilization
also discussed at length in technics and civilization is mumford s division of human civilization into three distinct epochs  following concepts originated by patrick geddes  
megamachines
mumford also refers to large hierarchical organizations as megamachines a machine using humans as its components these organizations characterize mumford s stage theory of civilization the most recent megamachine manifests itself according to mumford in modern technocratic nuclear powers mumford used the examples of the soviet and united states power complexes represented by the kremlin and the pentagon respectively the builders of the pyramids the roman empire and the armies of the world wars are prior examples
he explains that meticulous attention to accounting and standardization and elevation of military leaders to divine status are spontaneous features of megamachines throughout history he cites such examples as the repetitive nature of egyptian paintings which feature enlarged pharaohs and public display of enlarged portraits of communist leaders such as mao zedong and joseph stalin he also cites the overwhelming prevalence of quantitative accounting records among surviving historical fragments from ancient egypt to nazi germany
necessary to the construction of these megamachines is an enormous bureaucracy of humans which act as  servo-units  working without ethical involvement according to mumford technological improvements such as the assembly line or instant global wireless communication and remote control can easily weaken the perennial psychological barriers to certain types of questionable actions an example which he uses is that of adolf eichmann the nazi official who organized logistics in support of the holocaust mumford collectively refers to people willing to carry out placidly the extreme goals of these megamachines as  eichmanns 
the clock as herald of the industrial revolution
one of the better-known studies of mumford is of the way the mechanical clock was developed by monks in the middle ages and subsequently adopted by the rest of society he viewed this device as the key invention of the whole industrial revolution contrary to the common view of the steam engine holding the prime position writing   the clock not the steam-engine is the key-machine of the modern industrial age  the clock  is a piece of power-machinery whose  product  is seconds and minutes  
urban civilization
the city in history won the 1962 us national book award for nonfiction in this influential book mumford explored the development of urban civilizations harshly critical of urban sprawl mumford argues that the structure of modern cities is partially responsible for many social problems seen in western society while pessimistic in tone mumford argues that urban planning should emphasize an organic relationship between people and their living spaces
mumford uses the example of the medieval city as the basis for the  ideal city  and claims that the modern city is too close to the roman city  the sprawling megalopolis  which ended in collapse  if the modern city carries on in the same vein mumford argues then it will meet the same fate as the roman city
mumford wrote critically of urban culture believing the city is  a product of earth  a fact of nature  man s method of expression  further mumford recognized the crises facing urban culture distrusting of the growing finance industry political structures fearful that a local community culture was not being fostered by these institutions mumford feared  metropolitan finance  urbanisation politics and alienation mumford wrote   the physical design of cities and their economic functions are secondary to their relationship to the natural environment and to the spiritual values of human community 
suburbia did not escape mumford s criticism either 
influence
mumford s interest in the history of technology and his explanation of  polytechnics  along with his general philosophical bent has been an important influence on a number of more recent thinkers concerned that technology serve human beings as broadly and well as possible some of these authors such as jacques ellul witold rybczynski richard gregg amory lovins j baldwin e f schumacher herbert marcuse murray bookchin thomas merton marshall mcluhan and colin ward have been intellectuals and persons directly involved with technological development and decisions about the use of technology
mumford also had an influence on the american environmental movement with thinkers like barry commoner and bookchin being influenced by his ideas on cities ecology and technology ramachandra guha noted his work contains  some of the earliest and finest thinking on bioregionalism anti-nuclearism biodiversity alternate energy paths ecological urban planning and appropriate technology 
mumford s influence is also evident in the work of some artists including berenice abbott s photographs of new york city in the late 1930s
mumford was an inspiration for ellsworth toohey the antagonist in ayn rand s novel the fountainhead  1943
