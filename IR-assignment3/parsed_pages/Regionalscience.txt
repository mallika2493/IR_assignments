regional science - wikipedia
regional science is a field of the social sciences concerned with analytical approaches to problems that are specifically urban rural or regional topics in regional science include but are not limited to location theory or spatial economics location modeling transportation migration analysis land use and urban development interindustry analysis environmental and ecological analysis resource management urban and regional policy analysis geographical information systems and spatial data analysis in the broadest sense any social science analysis that has a spatial dimension is embraced by regional scientists


origins
regional science was founded in the late 1940s when some economists began to become dissatisfied with the low level of regional economic analysis and felt an urge to upgrade it but even in this early era the founders of regional science expected to catch the interest of people from a wide variety of disciplines regional science s formal roots date to the aggressive campaigns by walter isard and his supporters to promote the  objective  and  scientific  analysis of settlement industrial location and urban development isard targeted key universities and campaigned tirelessly accordingly the regional science association was founded in 1954 when the core group of scholars and practitioners held its first meetings independent from those initially held as sessions of the annual meetings of the american economics association a reason for meeting independently undoubtedly was the group s desire to extend the new science beyond the rather restrictive world of economists and have natural scientists psychologists anthropologists lawyers sociologists political scientists planners and geographers join the club now called the regional science association international it maintains subnational and international associations journals and a conference circuit  notably in north america continental europe japan and south korea  membership in the rsai continues to grow
germinal publications
topically speaking regional science took off in the wake of walter christaller s book die zentralen orte in s ddeutschland  verlag von gustav fischer jena 1933  transl central places in southern germany 1966  soon followed by tord palander s  1935  beitr ge zur standortstheorie  august l sch s die r umliche ordnung der wirtschaft  verlag von gustav fischer jena 1940  2nd rev edit 1944  transl the economics of location 1954    and edgar m hoover s two books--location theory and the shoe and leather industry  1938  and the location of economic activity  1948  other important early publications include  edward h chamberlin s  1950  the theory of monopolistic competition   fran ois perroux s  1950  economic spaces  theory and application  torsten h gerstrand s  1953  innovationsf rloppet ur korologisk synpunkt  edgar s dunn s  1954 the location of agricultural production   martin j beckmann cb mcguire and clifford b winston s  1956  studies in the economics of transportation  melvin l greenhut s  1956  plant location in theory and practice  gunnar myrdal s  1957  economic theory and underdeveloped regions  albert o hirschman s  1958  the strategy of economic development  and claude ponsard s  1958  histoire des th ories  conomiques spatiales nonetheless walter isard s first book in 1956 location and space economy apparently captured the imagination of many and his third methods of regional analysis published in 1960 only sealed his position as the father of the field
as is typically the case the above works were built on the shoulders of giants much of this predecessor work is documented well in walter isard s location and space economy as well as claude ponsard s histoire des th orie  conomique spatiales particularly important was the contribution by 19th century german economists to location theory the early german hegemony more or less starts with johann heinrich von th nen and runs through both wilhelm launhardt and alfred weber to walter christaller and august l sch
core journals
if an academic discipline is identified by its journals then technically regional science began in 1955 with the publication of the first volume of the papers and proceedings regional science association  now papers in regional science published by springer  in 1958 the journal of regional science followed
most recently the journal spatial economic analysis has been published by the rsai british and irish section with the regional studies association the latter is a separate and growing organisation involving economists planners geographers political scientists management academics policymakers and practitioners
academic programs
walter isard s efforts culminated in the creation of a few academic departments and several university-wide programs in regional science at walter isard s suggestion the university of pennsylvania started the regional science department in 1956 it featured as its first graduate william alonso and was looked upon by many to be the international academic leader for the field another important graduate and faculty member of the department is masahisa fujita the core curriculum of this department was microeconomics input-output analysis location theory and statistics faculty also taught courses in mathematical programming transportation economics labor economics energy and ecological policy modeling spatial statistics spatial interaction theory and models benefit cost analysis urban and regional analysis and economic development theory among others but the department s unusual multidisciplinary orientation undoubtedly encouraged its demise and it lost its department status in 1993
with a few exceptions such as cornell university which awards graduate degrees in regional science most practitioners hold positions in departments such as economics geography civil engineering agricultural economics rural sociology urban planning public policy or demography the diversity of disciplines participating in regional science have helped make it one of the most interesting and fruitful fields of academic specialization but it has also made it difficult to fit the many perspectives into a curriculum for an academic major it is even difficult for authors to write regional science textbooks since what is elementary knowledge for one discipline might be entirely novel for another
public policy impact
part of the movement was and continues to be associated with the political and economic realities of the role of the local community on any occasion where public policy is directed at the sub-national level such as a city or group of counties the methods of regional science can prove useful traditionally regional science has provided policymakers with guidance on the following issues 
by targeting federal resources to specific geographic areas the kennedy administration realized that political favors could be bought this is also evident in europe and other places where local economic areas do not coincide with political boundaries in the more current era of devolution knowledge about  local solutions to local problems  has driven much of the interest in regional science thus there has been much political impetus to the growth of the discipline
developments after 1980
regional science has enjoyed mixed fortunes since the 1980s while it has gained a larger following among economists and public policy practitioners the discipline has fallen out of favor among more radical and post-modernist geographers in an apparent effort to secure a larger share of research funds geographers had the national science foundation s geography and regional science program renamed  geography and spatial sciences 
new economic geography
in 1991 paul krugman as a highly regarded international trade theorist put out a call for economists to pay more attention to economic geography in a book entitled geography and trade focusing largely on the core regional science concept of agglomeration economies krugman s call renewed interest by economists in regional science and perhaps more importantly founded what some term the  new economic geography  which enjoys much common ground with regional science broadly trained  new economic geographers  combine quantitative work with other research techniques for example at the london school of economics the unification of europe and the increased internationalization of the world s economic social and political realms has further induced interest in the study of regional as opposed to national phenomena the new economic geography appears to have garnered more interest in europe than in america where amenities notably climate have been found to better predict human location and re-location patterns as emphasized in recent work by mark partridge in 2008 krugman won the nobel memorial prize in economic sciences and his prize lecture has references both to work in regional science s location theory as well as economic s trade theory
criticisms
today there are dwindling numbers of regional scientists from academic planning programs and mainstream geography departments attacks on regional science s practitioners by radical critics began as early as the 1970s notably david harvey who believed it lacked social and political commitment regional science s founder walter isard never envisioned regional scientists would be political or planning activists in fact he suggested that they will seek to be sitting in front of a computer and surrounded by research assistants trevor j barnes suggests the decline of regional science practice among planners and geographers in north america could have been avoided he says  it is unreflective and consequently inured to change because of a commitment to a god s eye view it is so convinced of its own rightness of its archimedean position that it remained aloof and invariant rather than being sensitive to its changing local context
