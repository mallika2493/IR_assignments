recreation resource planning - wikipedia
recreation resource planning is the application of analytical tools to a systematic and deliberate process of decision making about the future management of recreation resources and recreation opportunities


principles
the society of recreation professionals  sorp wwwrecproorg  formerly the national association of recreation resource planners expanded its membership in 2012 to include all outdoor recreation professionals sorp is a non-profit professional organization whose mission is to promote advance and serve outdoor recreation professionals in research planning management and policy development
sorp believes that professional principles are imperative for two reasons 
professional principles help clarify institutional values and perspectives and help to provide a common understanding and nomenclature for professionals and interested stakeholders they serve as a guide and rule of thumb for making decisions and taking action and they help stakeholders to better understand planning and the recreation planning profession
professional principles help deter arbitrary and capricious decision making which is a violation of law the administrative procedure act  1946  60 stat 237 5 usca  set forth the legal standard that administrative decisions must be principled and reasoned  that is arbitrary and capricious decisions are in violation of law a set of professional principles can be submitted as demonstrable evidence in a court of law to refute allegations of being arbitrary and capricious
the following principles reflect important concepts and values subscribed to by sorp towards the recreation planning profession they also serve as a platform from which other sets of principles tier from such as those for visitor management interpretive planning facility design monitoring and visitor capacity full and deliberate consideration of these principles will contribute to a systematic reasoned and legally-sufficient recreation planning process and recreation plans
definition
recreation planning is a rational systematic decision-making process and as such it is a fundamental tool that deters our human tendencies to make decisions based on predisposition bias inadequate analysis group-think insular perspective resistance to change and excessive self-confidence it results in decisions that are more effective efficient fair reasoned and defensible
general precepts
1 recreation resource planners  recreation resource planners are professionals and should have a university degree in recreation resource planning urban or regional planning landscape architecture or a closely related field professional experience and professional certification  eg nrpa aicp  may also fulfill this educational standard
2 sound professional judgment  the standard for decision making in recreation planning is sound professional judgment defined as a reasonable decision that has given full and fair consideration to all of the appropriate information that is based on principled and reasoned analysis and the best available science and expertise and that complies with applicable laws
3 a contract with the recreating public  a recreation plan is a contract with the recreating public and affected stakeholders that transcends any one person or administration and as such should be detailed unambiguous and provide for accountability
4 represent the public interest  recreation resource planning is a collaborative public process that deters the bias of special interests political intervention or incremental unplanned decision making
5 recreation resources  recreation resources are those features in a setting that define a person s experience such as the natural and cultural resources special values attached to an area facilities infrastructure personnel and management regulations and actions
6 recreation opportunities  recreation planners plan for recreation opportunities defined as an occasion for a person to participate in a specific recreation activity in a particular outdoor setting in order to enjoy a desired recreation experience and gain the healthy benefits that accrue
7 recreation  the occasion of a person to participate in a specific recreation activity in a particular outdoor setting in order to enjoy a desired recreation experience and gain the healthy benefits that accrue  note---the historic term of  recreation  has largely been replaced by the phrase  recreation opportunity  as defined above 
8 recreation benefits  recreation resource planning should promote the environmental human and community wellness benefits that accrue from recreation participation such as improved physical and mental health family cohesion civility social integration child development economic stimulation work productivity resource stewardship and conservation ethic
9 recreation diversity  because there is no  average  recreationist it is important to plan for and maintain a spectrum of diverse recreation opportunities
10 systems approach  recreation resource planners must consider how their resources fit into a larger regional system how their potential recreation alternatives might contribute to regional recreation diversity and how their opportunities can be linked to larger systems
11 recreation justice  recreation resource planning helps to ensure that all people have an opportunity to enjoy our great outdoors without prejudice of race ethnicity age wealth gender beliefs or abilities planning should also ensure that treaty rights and the rights of aboriginal publics are fairly considered
12 recreation allocation  recreation resource planning requires recreation allocation decisions because not all types and amounts of people or activities can be accommodated in a particular setting at one time
13 recreation compatibility  some recreation uses are not compatible with other uses and recreation planners have the responsibility to determine what if any uses should be permitted and where those activities should be permitted strong preferences for specific recreation settings lead to competition for recreation resources among different user types conflict is also generated by how each user group perceives the others  actions and values
14 recreation niche  because not all people can be accommodated in all places recreation planning helps to focus on the special values and resources of a setting and to define the special niche within the larger spectrum of recreation opportunities
15 visitor capacity  visitor capacity is the prescribed number or supply of available visitor opportunities that will be accommodated in a specific location and specific time
16 resource sustainability  whereas natural and cultural resources define an outdoor recreation setting it is fundamental that recreation resource planning and plans address how to integrate recreation use so as to harmonize with protect enhance and sustain these important resources
17 reduction of impact  recreation planning should proactively consider ways to minimize and mitigate potential social and environmental impacts
18 recreation stewardship  recreation planning should consider how to best design manage and interpret settings so as to foster public appreciation understanding respect behaviors and partnerships that contribute to the stewardship of an area s natural and cultural resources and special values
19 resource caretakers  recreation planners also have a responsibility to consider how plans and decisions will affect the kind of resource legacy will be left to the next generation
principles for the planning process
20 a process  while the specific terms and steps in a recreation planning process often vary across institutions all recreation resource planning in some manner includes 
identification of public issues management concerns opportunities and threats through collaborative stakeholder involvement establishment of planning and decision criteria for evaluating and selecting the preferred alternative inventory of resources the current situation and the best available science and information formulation of alternatives which address the significant issues and concerns evaluation of the consequences benefits and affects of each proposed alternative selection of a preferred alternative based upon a full and reasoned analysis implementation and monitoring plan adaptation or revision
21 legally sufficient  recreation resource planning is framed by various local state and federal laws and regulations with the most significant and historic direction provided by the national environmental policy act  1969  and its attendant council on environmental quality regulations
22 judicial doctrine  good recreation planning is based upon the important judicial principles of being principled reasoned reasonable sufficient full fair and preponderance of the information
23 planning considerations  an adequate recreation resource planning process and plan must address all of the significant public issues management concerns opportunities and threats that are identified in the early stages of the planning process issues concerns opportunities and threats that are not deemed significant do not need to be addressed in the plan
24 planning inputs  recreation resource planning requires the consideration of many inputs such as an inventory of existing plans and policies current type and amount of recreation use  supply and demand  recreation trends public issues management concerns regional supply of recreation opportunities visitor and stakeholder preferences economic impact of recreation participation best available science environmental conditions and available information from recreation and resource monitoring
25 recreation resource publics  recreation resource planning must try to engage and hear from all the diverse publics who value the recreation resource the easily recognizable publics are often labeled visitors local business land owners and communities but there may also be equally important publics who vicariously value the resource some who have been displaced by past unacceptable conditions some who do not have the ability to attend meetings or some who live across the country but equally share in the ownership of the public resource
26 collaboration  the meaningful engagement and exchange with the public is essential throughout the planning process collaboration results in a clearer definition of public values more creative alternatives more reasoned and reasonable decisions and a constituency that becomes better informed and committed to the plan and its implementation
27 science-informed planning  it is both a legal requirement and professional imperative to duly consider the best available science and expertise in the planning process and the plan s implementation
28 comprehensive and integrated  recreation planning should consider other significant natural and cultural resources uses demands and values in an integrated and comprehensive fashion functional planning whereby one resource is planned for in a vacuum from other resources is not appropriate and contrary to comprehensive and integrated planning
29 clear management alternatives  recreation alternatives must be clear comprehensive and provide a reasonable range of choices for public consideration each alternative can be contrasted by its proposed objectives desired future conditions desired recreation experiences facilities management strategies and actions quality standards visitor capacities economic value projected budget requirements and monitoring program
30 rigorous analysis  the analytical stage in a planning process is the evaluation of alternatives whereby the alternatives should be sharply contrasted and the pros and cons are rigorously evaluated so the reasons for and against each alternative become clear
principles for the plan
31 the document  the effectiveness and utility of a plan is in part a function of its clarity brevity layout and design materials used in the planning process should be retained in the administrative record but the final approved document should be a valuable desktop working document
32 resource management prescription  the output of a recreation resource planning process is a management prescription for an area that includes such information as goals objectives desired future conditions desired recreation experiences facilities management strategies and actions quality standards visitor capacities a monitoring program and budgetary needs
33 budgetary tool  an effective recreation plan should include the projected budgetary needs to implement the plan in this way the plan is a tool to prepare and justify annual budgets for allocating budgets and to guide annual work priorities and facilitate the scheduling and sequencing of projects
principles for implementation
34 implementing partnerships  the successful implementation of a plan should involve collaboration with stakeholders government agencies partnerships and alliances with communities special interest groups and the private sector
35 institutional accountability  the responsible official charged with implementing the plan should periodically evaluate and report to the public on progress and accomplishments to date factors affecting the plan s implementation and changes pending or made to the approved plan
36 plan adaptability  a recreation resource plan should be adaptive to new science information uses technology trends conditions and other circumstances of importance any proposed change should be subject to the same level of deliberate analysis and public collaboration as went into the original decision
37 review and revision  given the significant and ongoing changes in our society and the recreation industry it would be reasonable that recreation plans be formally reviewed and updated every 5 10 years
these principles were developed by the board of directors of the national association of recreation resource planners with input solicited from more than 1000 recreation planning professionals and approved by the board for distribution in april 2009
