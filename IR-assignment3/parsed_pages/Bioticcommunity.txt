biocoenosis - wikipedia
a biocenosis  uk english biocoenosis also biocenose biocoenose biotic community biological community ecological community life assemblage  coined by karl m bius in 1877 describes the interacting organisms living together in a habitat  biotope 
in the palaeontological literature the term distinguishes  life assemblages  which reflect the original living community living together at one place and time in other words it is an assemblage of fossils or a community of specific timewhich is different from  death assemblages   thanatocoenoses  of course no palaeontological assemblage will ever completely represent the original biological community  ie the biocoenosis in the sense used by an ecologist   the term thus has somewhat different meanings in a palaeontological and an ecological context
based on the concept of biocenosis ecological communities can take in various forms
the geographical extent of a biocenose is limited by the requirement of a more or less uniform species composition


ecosystems
an ecosystem originally defined by tansley  1935  is a biotic community  or biocenosis  along with its physical environment  or biotope  in ecological studies biocenosis is the emphasis on relationships between species in an area these relationships are an additional consideration to the interaction of each species with the physical environment
biotic communities
biotic communities vary in size and larger ones may contain smaller ones species interactions are evident in food or feeding relationships a method of delineating biotic communities is to map the food network to identify which species feed upon which others and then determine the system boundary as the one that can be drawn through the fewest consumption links relative to the number of species within the boundary
mapping biotic communities is important identifying sites needing environmental protection such as the british site of special scientific interest  sssis  the australian department of the environment and heritage maintains a register of threatened species and threatened ecological communities under the environment protection and biodiversity conservation act 1999  epbc act
