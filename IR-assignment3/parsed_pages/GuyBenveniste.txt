intellectual legacy
planning theory
while at berkeley benveniste published a series of books on the sociology of planning and bureaucracy his politics of expertise and subsequent volumes analyzed the process of planning or of giving technical advice benveniste argued that planners and experts had to consider political realities in the context of their technical arguments if their plans were not to be shelved or stay in limbo in this way he was an early proponent of and contributor to the literature on the problems of implementing ideas into action
his first paper on the sociology of planning was published in 1968 he and other early writers argued that planners needed more than a good understanding of the technical problems of planning they needed to understand the political and organizational context in which planning took place benveniste provided a theoretical argument to help articulate the technical reality to its political and organizational context his work was always somewhat controversial since it suggested bending some truth to power
his publications span a quarter century his first book an analysis of planning in mexico was published in 1970 he was one of the first contributors to a better understanding of the political dimensions of planning and reform as such his work received considerable attention at the time he thus criticized the rational planning model and contributed to a better understanding of the urban planning process later benveniste espoused a far more active political role for planners in his mastering the politics of planning  1994  this work received considerable attention and a 1993 issue of the journal planning theory with nine articles was devoted to it
