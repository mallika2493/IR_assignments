after serving in the royal engineers during world war ii and attaining the rank of lieutenant-colonel he left to join the new ministry of town and country planning overseeing planning enquiries into slum clearance and reconciling traffic planning and environmental policies
in 1960 the minister of transport ernest marples appointed buchanan to head a working group in the ministry of transport in 1963 the group produced the influential buchanan report which proposed how british towns could be redesigned to accommodate growing motor car use car numbers in the uk were expected to quadruple over the coming decades in 1964 penguin books published traffic in towns which was a concise version of the 1963 buchanan report buchanan s policy recommendations were widely accepted and became a blueprint for urban redevelopment until the end of the century
he retired from the ministry in 1963 and held the new chair of transport at imperial college london and formed a successful consultancy colin buchanan and partners that developed into a limited company employing around 300 staff and was subsequently chaired by his son malcolm buchanan from 2011 it became skm colin buchanan
between 1973 and 1975 colin buchanan was head of the newly established school of advanced urban studies at bristol university
in 1968-70 he was a member of the commission for the third london airport  the  roskill commission   with a brief  to enquire into the timing of the need for a four-runway airport to cater for the growth of traffic at existing airports serving the london area to consider the various alternative sites and to recommend which site should be selected 
the commission s 1971 report recommended that a site at cublington in buckinghamshire  to the north-east of london  should be developed as london s third airport but in a minority opinion buchanan totally rejected the 146-page economic analysis proposing cublington because of the policy need to protect the open countryside around london   it is simply unthinkable that an airport and all it implies should be brought here  and recommended maplin sands  also known as foulness  to the east of london
an act of parliament was passed   the maplin development act 1973   that paved the way for a thames estuary airport at maplin sands however the maplin proposal was shelved after the 1973 oil crisis and all plans for a new four-runway airport were replaced by smaller-scale redevelopment of stansted a site not short-listed by the roskill commission
