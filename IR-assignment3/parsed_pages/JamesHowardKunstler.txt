reception
bill kauffman has called kunstler the  scourge of suburbia  and a  slashingly witty jeremiah  in a review of kunstler s weekly audio podcast the columbia journalism review described the kunstlercast as  a weekly podcast that offers some of the smartest most honest urban commentary around online or off  the albany new york times union reviewed kunstler s book world made by hand writing that  james howard kunstler is fiddling his way to the apocalypse one jig at a time  the paper described the book s scenario as  grim  with  an upside or two 
kunstler has been called  provocative and entertaining  by the new york times while the christian science monitor noted that  disturbing others  sense of normality is something kunstler does well everyone who knows his work acknowledges his power to wake up a crowd  in critiquing the long emergency journalist chris hayes claims that while kunstler makes valid points about the consequences of peak oil he undermines his credibility with rhetoric and perceived misanthropy joseph romm a climate change expert and senior fellow at the center for american progress has stated his belief that accelerating shifts toward renewable energy will maintain suburban lifestyles and that contrary to kunstler s arguments  suburbia won t be destroyed by peak oil 
charles bensinger co-founder of renewable energy partners of new mexico describes kunstler s views as  fashionably fear-mongering  and uninformed regarding the potential of renewable energy resources to eliminate the need for fossil fuels conversely paul salopek of the chicago tribune finds that  kunstler has plotted energy starvation to its logical extremes  and points to the us department of energy hirsch report as drawing similar conclusions david ehrenfeld writing for american scientist sees kunstler delivering a  powerful integration of science technology economics finance international politics and social change  with a  lengthy discussion of the alternatives to cheap oil
