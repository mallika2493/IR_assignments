geography - wikipedia
geography  from greek           geographia literally  earth description   is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands the features the inhabitants and the phenomena of earth the first person to use the word             was eratosthenes  276 194 bc  four historical traditions in geographical research are spatial analysis of the natural and the human phenomena  geography as the study of distribution  area studies  places and regions  study of the human-land relationship and research in the earth sciences nonetheless modern geography is an all-encompassing discipline that foremost seeks to understand the earth and all of its human and natural complexities not merely where objects are but how they have changed and come to be geography has been called  the world discipline  and  the bridge between the human and the physical science  geography is divided into two main branches  human geography and physical geography


introduction
traditionally geographers have been viewed the same way as cartographers and people who study place names and numbers although many geographers are trained in toponymy and cartology this is not their main preoccupation geographers study the space and the temporal database distribution of phenomena processes and features as well as the interaction of humans and their environment because space and place affect a variety of topics such as economics health climate plants and animals  geography is highly interdisciplinary the interdisciplinary nature of the geographical approach depends on an attentiveness to the relationship between physical and human phenomena and its spatial patterns
geography as a discipline can be split broadly into two main subsidiary fields  human geography and physical geography the former largely focuses on the built environment and how humans create view manage and influence space the latter examines the natural environment and how organisms climate soil water and landforms produce and interact the difference between these approaches led to a third field environmental geography which combines the physical and the human geography and looks at the interactions between the environment and humans
branches
physical geography
physical geography  or physiography  focuses on geography as an earth science it aims to understand the physical problems and the issues of lithosphere hydrosphere atmosphere pedosphere and global flora and fauna patterns  biosphere 
human geography
human geography is a branch of geography that focuses on the study of patterns and processes that shape the human society it encompasses the human political cultural social and economic aspects
various approaches to the study of human geography have also arisen through time and include 
integrated geography
integrated geography is the branch of geography that describes the spatial aspects of interactions between humans and the natural world it requires an understanding of the traditional aspects of the physical and the human geography as well as the ways that human societies conceptualize the environment
integrated geography has emerged as a bridge between the human and the physical geography as a result of the increasing specialisation of the two sub-fields furthermore as human relationship with the environment has changed as a result of globalization and technological change a new approach was needed to understand the changing and dynamic relationship examples of areas of research in the environmental geography include  emergency management environmental management sustainability and political ecology
geomatics
geomatics is a branch of geography that has emerged since the quantitative revolution in geography in the mid-1950s geomatics involves the use of traditional spatial techniques used in cartography and topography and their application to computers geomatics has become a widespread field with many other disciplines using techniques such as gis and remote sensing geomatics has also led to a revitalization of some geography departments especially in northern america where the subject had a declining status during the 1950s
geomatics encompasses a large area of fields involved with spatial analysis such as cartography geographic information systems  gis  remote sensing and global positioning systems  gps 
regional geography
regional geography is a branch of geography which studies the regions of all sizes across the earth it has a prevailing descriptive character the main aim is to understand or define the uniqueness or character of a particular region that consists of natural as well as human elements attention is paid also to regionalization which covers the proper techniques of space delimitation into regions
regional geography is also considered as a certain approach to study in geographical sciences  similar to quantitative or critical geographies for more information see history of geography 
related fields
techniques
as spatial interrelationships are key to this synoptic science maps are a key tool classical cartography has been joined by a more modern approach to geographical analysis computer-based geographic information systems  gis 
in their study geographers use four interrelated approaches 
cartography
cartography studies the representation of the earth s surface with abstract symbols  map making  although other subdisciplines of geography rely on maps for presenting their analyses the actual making of maps is abstract enough to be regarded separately cartography has grown from a collection of drafting techniques into an actual science
cartographers must learn cognitive psychology and ergonomics to understand which symbols convey information about the earth most effectively and behavioural psychology to induce the readers of their maps to act on the information they must learn geodesy and fairly advanced mathematics to understand how the shape of the earth affects the distortion of map symbols projected onto a flat surface for viewing it can be said without much controversy that cartography is the seed from which the larger field of geography grew most geographers will cite a childhood fascination with maps as an early sign they would end up in the field
geographic information systems
geographic information systems  gis  deal with the storage of information about the earth for automatic retrieval by a computer in an accurate manner appropriate to the information s purpose in addition to all of the other subdisciplines of geography gis specialists must understand computer science and database systems gis has revolutionized the field of cartography  nearly all mapmaking is now done with the assistance of some form of gis software gis also refers to the science of using gis software and gis techniques to represent analyse and predict the spatial relationships in this context gis stands for geographic information science
remote sensing
remote sensing is the science of obtaining information about earth features from measurements made at a distance remotely sensed data comes in many forms such as satellite imagery aerial photography and data obtained from hand-held sensors geographers increasingly use remotely sensed data to obtain information about the earth s land surface ocean and atmosphere because it  a  supplies objective information at a variety of spatial scales  local to global  b  provides a synoptic view of the area of interest c  allows access to distant and inaccessible sites d  provides spectral information outside the visible portion of the electromagnetic spectrum and e  facilitates studies of how features areas change over time remotely sensed data may be analysed either independently of or in conjunction with other digital data layers  eg in a geographic information system 
quantitative methods
geostatistics deal with quantitative data analysis specifically the application of statistical methodology to the exploration of geographic phenomena geostatistics is used extensively in a variety of fields including hydrology geology petroleum exploration weather analysis urban planning logistics and epidemiology the mathematical basis for geostatistics derives from cluster analysis linear discriminant analysis and non-parametric statistical tests and a variety of other subjects applications of geostatistics rely heavily on geographic information systems particularly for the interpolation  estimate  of unmeasured points geographers are making notable contributions to the method of quantitative techniques
qualitative methods
geographic qualitative methods or ethnographical research techniques are used by human geographers in cultural geography there is a tradition of employing qualitative research techniques also used in anthropology and sociology participant observation and in-depth interviews provide human geographers with qualitative data
history
the oldest known world maps date back to ancient babylon from the 9th century bc the best known babylonian world map however is the imago mundi of 600 bc the map as reconstructed by eckhard unger shows babylon on the euphrates surrounded by a circular landmass showing assyria urartu and several cities in turn surrounded by a  bitter river   oceanus  with seven islands arranged around it so as to form a seven-pointed star the accompanying text mentions seven outer regions beyond the encircling ocean the descriptions of five of them have survived in contrast to the imago mundi an earlier babylonian world map dating back to the 9th century bc depicted babylon as being further north from the center of the world though it is not certain what that center was supposed to represent
the ideas of anaximander  c 610 bc-c 545 bc   considered by later greek writers to be the true founder of geography come to us through fragments quoted by his successors anaximander is credited with the invention of the gnomon the simple yet efficient greek instrument that allowed the early measurement of latitude thales is also credited with the prediction of eclipses the foundations of geography can be traced to the ancient cultures such as the ancient medieval and early modern chinese the greeks who were the first to explore geography as both art and science achieved this through cartography philosophy and literature or through mathematics there is some debate about who was the first person to assert that the earth is spherical in shape with the credit going either to parmenides or pythagoras anaxagoras was able to demonstrate that the profile of the earth was circular by explaining eclipses however he still believed that the earth was a flat disk as did many of his contemporaries one of the first estimates of the radius of the earth was made by eratosthenes
the first rigorous system of latitude and longitude lines is credited to hipparchus he employed a sexagesimal system that was derived from babylonian mathematics the meridians were sub-divided into 360  with each degree further subdivided 60   minutes  to measure the longitude at different location on earth he suggested using eclipses to determine the relative difference in time the extensive mapping by the romans as they explored new lands would later provide a high level of information for ptolemy to construct detailed atlases he extended the work of hipparchus using a grid system on his maps and adopting a length of 56.5 miles for a degree
from the 3rd century onwards chinese methods of geographical study and writing of geographical literature became much more complex than what was found in europe at the time  until the 13th century  chinese geographers such as liu an pei xiu jia dan shen kuo fan chengda zhou daguan and xu xiake wrote important treatises yet by the 17th century advanced ideas and methods of western-style geography were adopted in china
during the middle ages the fall of the roman empire led to a shift in the evolution of geography from europe to the islamic world muslim geographers such as muhammad al-idrisi produced detailed world maps  such as tabula rogeriana  while other geographers such as yaqut al-hamawi abu rayhan biruni ibn battuta and ibn khaldun provided detailed accounts of their journeys and the geography of the regions they visited turkish geographer mahmud al-kashgari drew a world map on a linguistic basis and later so did piri reis  piri reis map  further islamic scholars translated and interpreted the earlier works of the romans and the greeks and established the house of wisdom in baghdad for this purpose ab  zayd al-balkh  originally from balkh founded the  balkh  school  of terrestrial mapping in baghdad suhr b a late tenth century muslim geographer accompanied a book of geographical coordinates with instructions for making a rectangular world map with equirectangular projection or cylindrical equidistant projection
abu rayhan biruni  976-1048  first described a polar equi-azimuthal equidistant projection of the celestial sphere he was regarded as the most skilled when it came to mapping cities and measuring the distances between them which he did for many cities in the middle east and the indian subcontinent he often combined astronomical readings and mathematical equations in order to develop methods of pin-pointing locations by recording degrees of latitude and longitude he also developed similar techniques when it came to measuring the heights of mountains depths of the valleys and expanse of the horizon he also discussed human geography and the planetary habitability of the earth he also calculated the latitude of kath khwarezm using the maximum altitude of the sun and solved a complex geodesic equation in order to accurately compute the earth s circumference which were close to modern values of the earth s circumference his estimate of 6,339.9 km for the earth radius was only 16.8 km less than the modern value of 6,356.7 km in contrast to his predecessors who measured the earth s circumference by sighting the sun simultaneously from two different locations al-biruni developed a new method of using trigonometric calculations based on the angle between a plain and mountain top which yielded more accurate measurements of the earth s circumference and made it possible for it to be measured by a single person from a single location
the european age of discovery during the 16th and the 17th centuries where many new lands were discovered and accounts by european explorers such as christopher columbus marco polo and james cook revived a desire for both accurate geographic detail and more solid theoretical foundations in europe the problem facing both explorers and geographers was finding the latitude and longitude of a geographic location the problem of latitude was solved long ago but that of longitude remained  agreeing on what zero meridian should be was only part of the problem it was left to john harrison to solve it by inventing the chronometer h-4 in 1760 and later in 1884 for the international meridian conference to adopt by convention the greenwich meridian as zero meridian
the 18th and the 19th centuries were the times when geography became recognized as a discrete academic discipline and became part of a typical university curriculum in europe  especially paris and berlin  the development of many geographic societies also occurred during the 19th century with the foundations of the soci t  de g ographie in 1821 the royal geographical society in 1830 russian geographical society in 1845 american geographical society in 1851 and the national geographic society in 1888 the influence of immanuel kant alexander von humboldt carl ritter and paul vidal de la blache can be seen as a major turning point in geography from a philosophy to an academic subject
over the past two centuries the advancements in technology with computers have led to the development of geomatics and new practices such as participant observation and geostatistics being incorporated into geography s portfolio of tools in the west during the 20th century the discipline of geography went through four major phases  environmental determinism regional geography the quantitative revolution and critical geography the strong interdisciplinary links between geography and the sciences of geology and botany as well as economics sociology and demographics have also grown greatly especially as a result of earth system science that seeks to understand the world in a holistic view
