athens charter - wikipedia
the athens charter  french  charte d ath nes  was a document about urban planning published by the swiss architect le corbusier in 1943 the work was based upon le corbusier s ville radieuse  radiant city  book of 1935 and urban studies undertaken by the congr s international d architecture moderne  ciam  in the early 1930s
the charter got its name from location of the fourth ciam conference in 1933 which due to the deteriorating political situation in russia took place on the ss patris bound for athens from marseilles
the charter had a huge impact on urban planning after world war ii


background
although le corbusier had exhibited his ideas for the ideal city the ville contemporaine in the 1920s during the early 1930s after contact with international planners he began work on the ville radieuse  radiant city  in 1930 he had become an active member of the syndicalist movement and proposed the ville radieuse as a blueprint of social reform
unlike the radial design of the ville contemporaine the ville radieuse was a linear city based upon the abstract shape of the human body with head spine arms and legs the design maintained the idea of high-rise housing blocks free circulation and abundant green spaces proposed in his earlier work le corbusier exhibited the first representations of his ideas at the third ciam meeting in brussels in 1930 and published a book of the same title as the city in 1935
the functional city
the concept of the functional city came to dominate ciam thinking after the conference in brussels at a meeting in z rich in 1931 ciam members le corbusier walter gropius siegfried giedion rudolf steiger and werner m moser discussed with cornelis van eesteren the importance of solar orientation in governing the directional positioning of low-cost housing on a given site van eesteren had been chief architect of amsterdam s urban development section since 1929 and the group asked him to prepare a number of analytical studies of cities ready for the next main ciam meeting planned to be in moscow in 1933 the theme for these studies would be the functional city that is one where land planning would be based upon function-based zones
van eesteren employed the city planner theodor karel van lohuizen to use methods developed for the amsterdam expansion plan to prepare zoning plans that would predict overall future development in the city he relied upon the more rational methods being promoted by ciam at that time which sought to use statistical information for designing zone uses rather than designing them in any detail
at a special congress meeting in berlin later in 1931 van eesteren presented his findings to his colleagues he presented three drawings of amsterdam the first at a scale of 1 10000 showed land use and density the second showed transportation networks and the third at 1 50000 showed the regional setting of the city he also presented supporting information on the four functions of dwelling work recreation and transport based upon his presentation it was decided that the separate national groups within ciam would prepare similar presentation boards for the moscow meeting a standard set of notation was agreed
in 1932 le corbusier s palace of the soviets competition entry failed to gain acceptance from the jury and due to the political conditions in russia ciam s agenda became increasingly ignored a new venue for the fourth ciam conference was required
ciam 4
the fourth ciam conference took place on board the ss patris an ocean-going liner journeying from marseilles to athens in july 1933
the national groups reported to the conference with the findings from their city studies presenting in each case the agreed three boards showing a total of 34 cities in addition le corbusier and the group who had met earlier in z rich hosted a meeting to state the core goals of the functional city
on arrival in athens on 3 august an exhibition of the functional city boards was held at the national technical university of athens and inaugurated by greece s prime minister the boards were separated into seven categories  metropolises cities of administration ports industrial cities pleasure cities and cities of diverse function the delegates remained in athens for a number of days some visited local classical sites and others visited nearby islands on 10 august they embarked on the return journey to marseilles
during meetings on the return journey delegates found it impossible to agree on resolutions for the functional city van eesteren s original amsterdam plan had with greater resources a basis formed by scientific data the plans presented by the national groups did not have this and despite giedion s insistence delegates were reluctant to agree on guidelines eventually two groups agreed on two separate texts  observations and resolutions
the athens charter
the observations taken from the studies of 33 cities set guidelines under the titles  living working recreation and circulation
additionally they said it was important to reduce commuting times by locating industrial zones close to residential ones and buffering them with wide parks and sports areas street widths and requirements should be scientifically worked out to accommodate the speed and type of transport finally with regards to conservation historic monuments should be kept only when they were of true value and their conservation did not reduce their inhabitants to unhealthy living conditions
the observations formed the basis of josep llu s sert s book can our cities survive  and were incorporated in le corbusier s athens charter published in 1943 the resolutions formed part of le corbusier s book the radiant city published in 1935
the text of the athens charter as published became an extension of the content of the radiant city and le corbusier significantly re-worded the original observations as well as adding new material he also removed the urban plans upon which the original text was based this treatment made the athens charter an abstract text of general value but also transformed the original force of the observations that were founded before on concrete references despite its title the athens charter cannot be considered as the mutual outcome of the ciam conference which took place ten years earlier but largely as an expression of le courbusier s individual concerns
pre-war influence
the ciam 4 meeting was influential among attending architects from switzerland france england germany austria belgium the netherlands italy spain greece finland denmark norway poland czechoslovakia yugoslavia brazil and canada
after the radiant city was published in france in 1935 le corbusier continued to develop his ideas of urban planning through a number of unrealised schemes these included plans for antwerp paris moscow algiers and morocco
in the netherlands ciam delegates visited the van nelle factory designed in part by mart stam that was to have formed a larger part of a functional city design
ciam 4 was the first congress that the influential mars group from england was represented in 1935 mars member berthold lubetkin and his practice the tecton group completed highpoint in highgate london the project comprised 56 dwellings grouped together as two crosses on plan eight dwellings per arm each dwelling is linked to a central service core but is separated from its neighbour by a balcony - a design feature that virtually eliminated noise transfer between dwellings
in 1937 with the fall of the second spanish republic sert suggested that england and the united states may be the best place to focus ciam s activities
post-war influence
the athens charter had a huge impact on planning thought after world war ii however its influence was more complicated because in the 1950s ciam attempted to replace the functional city described in the charter with a different charter of habitat
france
in 1946 le corbusier received a commission for projects in la rochelle and st di  the urban plan allowed him to experiment with urban monumentality that had been somewhat underplayed in the charter but as part of the project he proposed eight unit  d habitation flanked by a civic centre although these proposals were unbuilt he had more success in marseilles where an initial study for three unit s resulted in one being built in line with the charter the unit  was a north-south orientated block eighteen storeys high set in parkland there is a public  street  on levels 7 and 8 that provides various shops offices and a hotel on the roof there is a nursery school a running track and a pool it opened in 1952 but had begun to influence architects even before it was complete
united kingdom
the 1949 housing act in england paved the way for local authorities to provide a balance of housing types for a range of communities not just the working class in the socialist post war atmosphere architectural writer j m richards praised le corbusier s unit  for  putting clean and healthy housing in a parkland setting 
between 1952 and 1958 london county council built the alton east and alton west high-rise blocks in roehampton alton east comprised 744 dwellings within mainly 10 storey blocks and alton west was 1867 dwellings in 5 6 and 12 storey blocks both projects are set within parkland and have since been listed
in sheffield in 1958 the city architect lewis womersley designed the park hill estate the product of an entire slum clearance three times the size of the unit  dwellings were housed in a series of high rise structures connected by external decks these  streets in the air  are wide enough to incorporate bicycles and milk floats initial success came because whole streets were moved into adjacent dwellings on the new scheme harold macmillan said it would  draw the admiration of the world 
in scotland the department of housing for scotland encouraged local authorities to build more unified and open schemes the functional city prescribed the separation of industrial zones from residential ones by parkland this concept suited the regeneration of industrial decay in scottish cities from 1956 the hutchesontown gorbals area of glasgow was redeveloped the architect robert matthew designed one of the four areas using 18 storey blocks on a north-south axis that ignored local street patterns
in 1962 alison and peter smithson designed a 17 storey residential tower in golden lane london it has a variety of dwellings and a good provision of supporting community buildings like the unit  it has a terrace on the roof the smithsons were against the four functions explored for the functional city renaming them house street district and city in the golden lane development the house became the family unit the street was an elevated access deck but the district and city lay outside the project s boundaries although they rejected the way that the ville radieuse was touted around by le corbusier they did the same thing with golden lane
the americas
lucio costa s conception of the plan for bras lia saw the city as a manifestation of the functional city like le corbusier s ville radieuse it was seen as a method of imposing order progress and stability to brazil s new capital like le corbusier costa and oscar niemeyer aspired to produce a city based upon equality and justice
in a variation of the functional city sert designed married-student housing for harvard university in 1964 known as peabody terraces it was made up of three main towers set in lawns and sheltered pedestrian routes it avoided the usual vacuum at the base by grading the scale between the towers and the lawns
the rest of the world
in japan in 1957 kunio maekawa designed the harumi apartment block in tokyo based upon the idea of the unit  meanwhile in tel aviv in 1963 ciam member jacob b bakema designed a functional city proposal based upon le corbusier s algiers scheme
criticism
the pruitt igoe housing scheme in st louis missouri was designed in accordance with ciam ideals for the functional city it was made up of 14 storey blocks and is often claimed to have won an american institute of architects award when it was built in 1951 but no evidence of such exists charles jencks proclaimed that the death of modern architecture was on 15 july 1972 at 3.32pm when the pruitt igoe housing scheme was demolished with dynamite
architectural critic reyner banham was concerned that the supposed universality of the charter concealed a very narrow view of architecture and planning that overly constrained the members of ciam the emphasis on tall high-density housing amongst wide green spaces effectively killed research into other areas of urban housing
in planning terms the charter had set rigid geometries for urban planning increasingly there became an awareness of words like  neighbourhood   cluster  and  association  that demanded a more organic approach to the image of the city
even by 1954 during the aix-en-provence meeting of ciam the younger generation riled against the pre-war utopian ideals that the charter represented this disillusionment would lead to the formation of team x at the dubrovnik meeting of ciam that would eventually lead to the breakup of the conference as an organisation
in the case of bras lia whilst niemeyer remained faithful to the ideas of zoning and green spaces his revised urban utopia became based upon a smaller city with a high vertical concentration of people with increased pedestrian facilities in 1958 he had warned that his utopian dream could not be fulfilled unless society itself was reorganised to suit it at its inauguration the city was branded a kafkaesque nightmare with an orwellian environment
recent history
in 2003 the european council of spatial planners wrote a new version of the charter
