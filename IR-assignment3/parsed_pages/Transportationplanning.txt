transportation planning - wikipedia
transportation planning is the process of defining future policies goals investments and designs to prepare for future needs to move people and goods to destinations as practiced today it is a collaborative process that incorporates the input of many stakeholders including various government agencies the public and private businesses transportation planners apply a multi-modal and or comprehensive approach to analyzing the wide range of alternatives and impacts on the transportation system to influence beneficial outcomes

transportation planning is also commonly referred to as transport planning internationally and is involved with the evaluation assessment design and siting of transport facilities  generally streets highways bike lanes and public transport lines 


models and sustainability
transportation planning or transport planning has historically followed the rational planning model of defining goals and objectives identifying problems generating alternatives evaluating alternatives and developing plans other models for planning include rational actor transit oriented development satisficing incremental planning organizational process and political bargaining
planners are increasingly expected to adopt a multi-disciplinary approach especially due to the rising importance of environmentalism for example the use of behavioural psychology to persuade drivers to abandon their automobiles and use public transport instead the role of the transport planner is shifting from technical analysis to promoting sustainability through integrated transport policies for example in hanoi the increasing number of motorcycles is responsible not only for environmental damage but also for slowing down economic growth in the long run the plan is to reduce traffic through a change in urban planning through economic incentives and attractive alternatives experts hope to lighten traffic in the short run
united kingdom
in the united kingdom transport planning was traditionally been a branch of civil engineering in the 1950s and 1960s it was generally believed that the motor car was an important element in the future of transport as economic growth spurred on car ownership figures the role of the transport planner was to match motorway and rural road capacity against the demands of economic growth urban areas would need to be redesigned for the motor vehicle or else impose traffic containment and demand management to mitigate congestion and environmental impacts these policies were popularised in a 1963 government publication traffic in towns the contemporary smeed report on congestion pricing was initially promoted to manage demand but was deemed politically unacceptable in more recent times this approach has been caricatured as  predict and provide    to predict future transport demand and provide the network for it usually by building more roads
the publication of planning policy guidance 13 in 1994  revised in 2001  followed by a new deal for transport in 1998 and the white paper transport ten year plan 2000 again indicated an acceptance that unrestrained growth in road traffic was neither desirable nor feasible the worries were threefold  concerns about congestion concerns about the effect of road traffic on the environment  both natural and built  and concerns that an emphasis on road transport discriminates against vulnerable groups in society such as the poor the elderly and the disabled
these documents reiterated the emphasis on integration 
this attempt to reverse decades of underinvestment in the transport system has resulted in a severe shortage of transport planners it was estimated in 2003 that 2,000 new planners would be required by 2010 to avoid jeopardising the success of the transport ten year plan 
during 2006 the transport planning society defined the key purpose of transport planning as 
the following key roles must be performed by transport planners 
the uk treasury recognises and has published guidance on the systematic tendency for project appraisers to be overly optimistic in their initial estimates
united states
transportation planning in the united states is in the midst of a shift similar to that taking place in the united kingdom away from the singular goal of moving vehicular traffic and towards an approach that takes into consideration the communities and lands through which streets roads and highways pass   the context   more so it places a greater emphasis on passenger rail networks which had been neglected until recently this new approach known as context sensitive solutions  css  seeks to balance the need to move people efficiently and safely with other desirable outcomes including historic preservation environmental sustainability and the creation of vital public spaces
the initial guiding principles of css came out of the 1998  thinking beyond the pavement  conference as a means to describe and foster transportation projects that preserve and enhance the natural and built environments as well as the economic and social assets of the neighborhoods they pass through css principles have since been adopted as guidelines for highway design in federal legislation also in 2003 the federal highway administration announced that under one of its three vital few objectives  environmental stewardship and streamlining  they set the target of achieving css integration within all state departments of transportation by september 2007
in recent years there has been a movement to provide  complete  transportation corridors under the  complete streets  movement in response to auto-centric design of transportation networks complete streets encompass all users and modes of transportation in a more equitable manner the complete streets movement entails many of the css principles as well as pedestrian bicycle and older adult movements to improve transportation in the united states
these recent pushes for changes to the profession of transportation planning has led to the development of a professional certification program by the institute of transportation engineers the professional transportation planner in 2007 in response an advanced form of certification - the advanced specialty certification in transportation planning was developed by the american planning association thereafter in 2011 the certified transportation planner credential is only available for those professional planners  aicp members  whom have at a minimum of eight years of transportation planning experience
the technical process
most regional transport planners employ what is called the rational model of planning the model views planning as a logical and technical process that uses the analysis of quantitative data to decide how to best invest resources in new and existing transport infrastructure
since world war ii this attitude in planning has resulted in the widespread use of travel modelling as a key component of regional transport planning the models  rise in popularity can also be attributed to a rapid increase in the number of automobiles on the road widespread suburbanization and a large increase in federal or national government spending upon transport in urban areas all of these phenomena dominated the planning culture in the late 1940s 1950s and 1960s regional transport planning was needed because increasingly cities weren t just cities anymore but parts of a complex regional system
the us process according to johnston  2004  and the fhwa and federal transit administration  fta   2007  generally follows a pattern which can be divided into three different stages over the course of each of three phases the metropolitan planning organization  mpo  is also supposed to consider air quality and environmental issues look at planning questions in fiscally constrained way and involve the public in the first stage called preanalysis the mpo considers what problems and issues the region faces and what goals and objectives it can set to help address those issues during this phase the mpo also collects data on wide variety of regional characteristics develops a set of different alternatives that will be explored as part of the planning process and creates a list of measurable outcomes that will be used to see whether goals and objectives have been achieved johnston notes that many mpos perform weakly in this area and though many of these activities seem like the  soft  aspects of planning that aren t really necessary they re absolutely essential to ensuring that the models used in second phase are accurate and complete 
the second phase is technical analysis the process involves much technical maneuvering but basically the development of the models can be broken down as follows before beginning the mpo collects enormous amounts of data this data can be thought of as falling into two categories  data about the transport system and data about adjacent land use the best mpos are constantly collecting this data
the actual analysis tool used in the us is called the urban transportation modeling system  utms  though it is often referred to as the four-step process as its nickname suggestions utms has four steps  trip generation trip distribution mode choice and trip route assignment in trip generation the region is subdivided into a large number of smaller units of analysis called traffic analysis zones  tazs  based on the number and characteristics of the households in each zone a certain number of trips is generated in the second step trip distribution trips are separated out into categories based on their origin and purpose  generally these categories are home-based work home-based other and non-home based in each of three categories trips are matched to origin and destination zones using the data that has been collected
in mode choice trips are assigned to a mode  usually auto or transit  based on what s available in a particular zone the characteristics of the household within that zone and the cost of the mode for each mode in terms of money and time since most trips by bicycle or walking are generally shorter they are assumed to have stayed within one zone and are not included in the analysis finally in route assignment trips are assigned to the network as particular parts of the network are assigned trips the vehicle speed slows down so some trips are assigned to alternate routes in such a way that all trip times are equal this is important because the ultimate goal is system-wide optimization not optimization for any one individual the finished product is traffic flows and speeds for each link in the network
ideally these models would include all the different behaviours that are associated with transport including complex policy questions which are more qualitative in nature because of the complexity of transport issues this is often not possible in practice this results in models which may estimate future traffic conditions well but are ultimately based on assumptions made on the part of the planner some planners carry out additional sub-system modelling on things like automobile ownership time of travel location of land development location and firms and location of households to help to fill these knowledge gaps but what are created are nevertheless models and models always include some level of uncertainty
the post-analysis phase involves plan evaluation programme implementation and monitoring of the results johnston notes that for evaluation to be meaningful it should be as comprehensive as possible for example rather than just looking at decreases in congestion mpos should consider economic equity and environmental issues
politics and transportation planning
although a transportation planning process may appear to be a rational process based on standard and objective methodologies it is often influenced by political processes transportation planning is closely interrelated to the public nature of government works projects as a result transportation planners play both a technical and a coordinating role politicians often have vastly differing perspectives goals and policy desires transportation planners help by providing information to decision makers such as politicians in a manner that produces beneficial outcomes this role is similar to transportation engineers who are often equally influenced by politics in the technical process of transportation engineering design
