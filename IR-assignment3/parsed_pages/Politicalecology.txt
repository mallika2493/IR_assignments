political ecology - wikipedia
political ecology is the study of the relationships between political economic and social factors with environmental issues and changes political ecology differs from apolitical ecological studies by politicizing environmental issues and phenomena
the academic discipline offers wide-ranging studies integrating ecological social sciences with political economy in topics such as degradation and marginalization environmental conflict conservation and control and environmental identities and social movements


origins
the term  political ecology  was first coined by frank thone in an article published in 1935 it has been widely used since then in the context of human geography and human ecology but with no systematic definition anthropologist eric r wolf gave it a second life in 1972 in an article entitled  ownership and political ecology  in which he discusses how local rules of ownership and inheritance  mediate between the pressures emanating from the larger society and the exigencies of the local ecosystem  but did not develop the concept further other origins include other early works of wolf as well as john w cole at the university of massachusetts hans magnus enzensberger and others in the 1970s and 1980s
the origins of the field in the 1970s and 1980s were a result of the development of development geography and cultural ecology particularly the work of piers blaikie on the sociopolitical origins of soil erosion historically political ecology has focused on phenomena in and affecting the developing world  since the field s inception  research has sought primarily to understand the political dynamics surrounding material and discursive struggles over the environment in the third world 
scholars in political ecology are drawn from a variety of academic disciplines including geography anthropology development studies political science sociology forestry and environmental history
overview
political ecology s broad scope and interdisciplinary nature lends itself to multiple definitions and understandings however common assumptions across the field give the term relevance raymond l bryant and sin ad bailey developed three fundamental assumptions in practicing political ecology 
in addition political ecology attempts to provide critiques and alternatives in the interplay of the environment and political economic and social factors paul robbins asserts that the discipline has a  normative understanding that there are very likely better less coercive less exploitative and more sustainable ways of doing things 
from these assumptions political ecology can be used to 
scope and influences
political ecology s movement as a field since its inception in the 1970s has complicated its scope and goals through the discipline s history certain influences have grown more and less influential in determining the focus of study peter a walker traces the importance of the ecological sciences in political ecology he points to the transition for many critics from a  structuralist  approach through the 1970s and 1980s in which ecology maintains a key position in the discipline to a  poststructuralist  approach with an emphasis on the  politics  in political ecology this turn has raised questions as to the differentiation with environmental politics as well as the field s use of the term of  ecology  political ecological research has shifted from investigating political influence on the earth s surface to the focus on spatial-ecological influences on politics and power a scope reminiscent of environmental politics
much has been drawn from cultural ecology a form of analysis that showed how culture depends upon and is influenced by the material conditions of society  political ecology has largely eclipsed cultural ecology as a form of analysis according to walker  as walker states  whereas cultural ecology and systems theory emphasize adaptation and homeostasis political ecology emphasize the role of political economy as a force of maladaptation and instability 
political ecologists often use political economy frameworks to analyze environmental issues early and prominent examples of this were the political economy of soil erosion in developing countries by piers blaikie in 1985 which traced land degradation in africa to colonial policies of land appropriation rather than over-exploitation by african farmers and silent violence  food famine and peasantry in northern nigeria by michael watts in 1983 which traced the famine in northern nigeria during the 1970s to the effects of colonialism rather than an inevitable consequence of the drought in the sahel
relationship to anthropology and geography
originating in the 18th and 19th centuries with philosophers such as adam smith karl marx and thomas malthus political economy attempted to explain the relationships between economic production and political processes it tended toward overly structuralist explanations focusing on the role of individual economic relationships in the maintenance of social order eric wolf used political economy in a neo-marxist framework which began addressing the role of local cultures as a part of the world capitalist system refusing to see those cultures as  primitive isolates  but environmental effects on political and economic processes were under-emphasised
conversely julian steward and roy rappaport s theories of cultural ecology are sometimes credited with shifting the functionalist-oriented anthropology of the 1950s and 1960s and incorporating ecology and environment into ethnographic study
geographers and anthropologists worked with the strengths of both to form the basis of political ecology pe focuses on issues of power recognizing the importance of explaining environmental impacts on cultural processes without separating out political and economic contexts
the application of political ecology in the work of anthropologists and geographers differs while any approach will take both the political economic and the ecological into accountthe emphasis can be unequal some such as geographer michael watts focus on how the assertion of power impacts on access to environmental resources his approach tends to see environmental harm as both a cause and an effect of  social marginalization 
political ecology has strengths and weaknesses at its core it contextualizes political and ecological explanations of human behavior but as walker points out it has failed to offer  compelling counter-narratives  to  widely influential and popular yet deeply flawed and unapologetic neo-malthusian rants such as robert kaplan s  1994   the coming anarchy  and jared diamond s  2005  collapse  385  ultimately applying political ecology to policy decisions   especially in the us and western europe   will remain problematic as long as there is a resistance to marxist and neo-marxist theory
andrew vayda and bradley walters  1999  criticize political ecologists for pre-supposing  the importance  of certain kinds of political factors in the explanation of environmental changes   167  vayda and walter s response to overly political approaches in political ecology is to encourage what they call  event ecology  focusing on human responses to environmental events without presupposing the impact of political processes on environmental events the critique has not been taken up widely
relationship to conservation
there is a divergence of ideas between conservation science and political ecology with conservationists establishing protected areas to conserve biodiversity  political ecologists have devoted some energy to the study of protected areas which is unsurprising given political ecology s overall interest in forms of access to and control over resources  the arguments against enclosure of land for conservation is that it harms local people and their livelihood systems by denying them access as dove and carpenter state  indigenous people have important environmental knowledge which could contribute to conservation  the objection by political ecologists is that land use regulations are made by ngos and the government denying access denying the ability of local people to conserve species and areas themselves and rendering them more vulnerable through dispossession
