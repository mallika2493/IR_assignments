overview
there are many separate societies that emerged around the globe differed markedly from each other and many of these differences persist to this day as well as the more obvious cultural differences that exist between people such as language dress and traditions there are also significant variations in the way societies organize themselves in their shared conception of morality and in the ways they interact with their environment cultural diversity can be seen as analogous to biodiversity
opposition and support
by analogy with biodiversity which is thought to be essential to the long-term survival of life on earth it can be argued that cultural diversity may be vital for the long-term survival of humanity  and that the conservation of indigenous cultures may be as important to humankind as the conservation of species and ecosystems is to life in general the general conference of unesco took this position in 2001 asserting in article 1 of the universal declaration on cultural diversity that  cultural diversity is as necessary for humankind as biodiversity is for nature 
this position is rejected by some people on several grounds firstly like most evolutionary accounts of human nature the importance of cultural diversity for survival may be an un-testable hypothesis which can neither be proved nor disproved secondly it can be argued that it is unethical deliberately to conserve  less developed  societies because this will deny people within those societies the benefits of technological and medical advances enjoyed by those in the  developed  world
in the same manner that the promotion of poverty in underdeveloped nations as  cultural diversity  is unethical it is similarly unethical to promote all religious practices simply because they are seen to contribute to cultural diversity particular religious practices are recognized by the who and un as unethical including female genital mutilation polygamy child brides and human sacrifice
with the onset of globalization traditional nation-states have been placed under enormous pressures today with the development of technology information and capital are transcending geographical boundaries and reshaping the relationships between the marketplace states and citizens in particular the growth of the mass media industry has largely impacted on individuals and societies across the globe although beneficial in some ways this increased accessibility has the capacity to negatively affect a society s individuality with information being so easily distributed throughout the world cultural meanings values and tastes run the risk of becoming homogenized as a result the strength of identity of individuals and societies may begin to weaken
some individuals particularly those with strong religious beliefs maintain that it is in the best interests of individuals and of humanity as a whole that all people adhere to a specific model for society or specific aspects of such a model
nowadays communication between different countries becomes more and more frequent and more and more students choose to study overseas for experiencing culture diversity their goal is to broaden their horizons and develop themselves from learning overseas for example according to fengling chen du yanjun and yu ma s paper  academic freedom in the people s republic of china and the united states of america  they pointed out that chinese education more focus on  traditionally teaching has consisted of spoon feeding and learning has been largely by rote china s traditional system of education has sought to make students accept fixed and ossified content  and  in the classroom chinese professors are the laws and authorities  students in china show great respect to their teachers in general  on another hand in united states of america education  american students treat college professors as equals  also  american students  are encouraged to debate topics the free open discussion on various topics is due to the academic freedom which most american colleges and universities enjoy  discussion above gives us an overall idea about the differences between china and the united states on education but we cannot simply judge which one is better because each culture has its own advantages and features thanks to those difference forms the culture diversity and those make our world more colorful for students who go abroad for education if they can combine positive culture elements from two different cultures to their self-development it would be a competitive advantage in their whole career especially with current process of global economics people who owned different perspectives on cultures stand at a more competitive position in current world
quantification
cultural diversity is tricky to quantify but a good indication is thought to be a count of the number of languages spoken in a region or in the world as a whole by this measure we may be going through a period of precipitous decline in the world s cultural diversity research carried out in the 1990s by david crystal  honorary professor of linguistics at the university of wales bangor  suggested that at that time on average one language was falling into disuse every two weeks he calculated that if that rate of the language death were to continue then by the year 2100 more than 90  of the languages currently spoken in the world will have gone extinct
overpopulation immigration and imperialism  of both the militaristic and cultural kind  are reasons that have been suggested to explain any such decline however it could also be argued that with the advent of globalism a decline in cultural diversity is inevitable because information sharing often promotes homogeneity
cultural heritage
the universal declaration on cultural diversity adopted by unesco in 2001 is a legal instrument that recognizes cultural diversity as  common heritage of humanity  and considers its safeguarding to be a concrete and ethical imperative inseparable from respect for human dignity
beyond the declaration of principles adopted in 2003 at the geneva phase of the world summit on the information society  wsis  the unesco convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions adopted in october 2005 is also regarded as a legally binding instrument that recognizes
it was adopted in response to  growing pressure exerted on countries to waive their right to enforce cultural policies and to put all aspects of the cultural sector on the table when negotiating international trade agreements  to date 116 member states as well as the european union have ratified the convention except the us australia and israel it is instead a clear recognition of the specificity of cultural goods and services as well as state sovereignty and public services in this area thought for world trade this soft law instrument  strength in not binding  clearly became a crucial reference to the definition of the european policy choice in 2009 the european court of justice favoured a broad view of culture   beyond cultural values through the protection of film or the objective of promoting linguistic diversity yet previously recognized  on top of it under this convention the eu and china have committed to fostering more balanced cultural exchanges strengthening international cooperation and solidarity with business and trade opportunities in cultural and creative industries the most motivating factor behind beijing s willingness to work in partnership at business level might certainly be the access to creative talents and skills from foreign markets
there is also the convention for the safeguarding of the intangible cultural heritage ratified on june 20 2007 by 78 states which said 
cultural diversity was also promoted by the montreal declaration of 2007 and by the european union the idea of a global multicultural heritage covers several ideas which are not exclusive  see multiculturalism  in addition to language diversity can also include religious or traditional practice
on a local scale agenda 21 for culture the first document of world scope that establishes the foundations for a commitment by cities and local governments to cultural development supports local authorities committed to cultural diversity
defense
the defense of cultural diversity can take several meanings 
cultural uniformity
cultural diversity is presented as the antithesis of cultural uniformity
some  including unesco  fear this hypothesis of a trend towards cultural uniformity to support this argument they emphasize different aspects 
there are several international organizations that work towards protecting threatened societies and cultures including survival international and unesco the unesco universal declaration on cultural diversity adopted by 185 member states in 2001 represents the first international standard-setting instrument aimed at preserving and promoting cultural diversity and intercultural dialogue indeed the notion of  cultural diversity  has been echoed by more neutral organizations particularly within the unesco beyond the declaration of principles adopted in 2003 at the geneva phase of the world summit on the information society  wsis  the unesco convention on the protection and promotion of the diversity of cultural expressions was adopted on 20 october 2005 but neither ratified by the us australia nor by israel it is instead a clear recognition of the specificity of cultural goods and services as well as state sovereignty and public services in this area thought for world trade this soft law instrument  strength in not binding  clearly became a crucial reference to the definition of the european policy choice in 2009 the european court of justice favoured a broad view of culture   beyond cultural values   through the protection of film or the objective of promoting linguistic diversity yet previously recognized on top of it under this convention the eu and china have committed to fostering more balanced cultural exchanges strengthening international cooperation and solidarity with business and trade opportunities in cultural and creative industries
the european commission-funded network of excellence on  sustainable development in a diverse world   known as  susdiv   builds upon the unesco declaration to investigate the relationship between cultural diversity and sustainable development
