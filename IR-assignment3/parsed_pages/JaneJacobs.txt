jane jacobs - wikipedia
jane jacobs oc oont  born jane butzner  may 4 1916   april 25 2006  was an american-canadian journalist author and activist best known for her influence on urban studies her influential book the death and life of great american cities  1961  argued that urban renewal did not respect the needs of most city-dwellers the book also introduced sociological concepts such as  eyes on the street  and  social capital 
jacobs was well known for organizing grassroots efforts to protect existing neighborhoods from  slum clearance    and particularly for her opposition to robert moses in his plans to overhaul her neighborhood greenwich village she was instrumental in the eventual cancellation of the lower manhattan expressway which would have passed directly through soho and little italy and was arrested in 1968 for inciting a crowd at a public hearing on the project after moving to toronto in 1968 she joined the opposition to the spadina expressway and the associated network of expressways in toronto planned and under construction
as a mother and a writer who criticized experts in the male-dominated field of urban planning jacobs endured scorn from established figures she did not have a college degree or any formal training in urban planning and was criticized for lacking such credentials


early years
jacobs was born jane butzner in scranton pennsylvania the daughter of john decker butzner a doctor and bess robison butzner a former teacher and nurse they were a protestant family in a heavily roman catholic town her brother john decker butzner jr served as a judge on the united states court of appeals for the fourth circuit after graduating from scranton high school she worked for a year as the unpaid assistant to the women s page editor at the scranton tribune
new york city
in 1935 during the great depression she moved to new york city with her sister betty jane butzner took an immediate liking to manhattan s greenwich village which did not conform to the city s grid structure the sisters soon moved there from brooklyn
during her first several years in the city jacobs held a variety of jobs working mainly as a stenographer and freelance writer often writing about working districts in the city these experiences she later said    gave me more of a notion of what was going on in the city and what business was like what work was like  her first job was for a trade magazine first as a secretary then as an editor she sold articles to the sunday herald tribune cue magazine and vogue
she studied at columbia university s school of general studies for two years taking courses in geology zoology law political science and economics about the freedom to pursue study across her wide-ranging interests she said 
career
after attending columbia university s school of general studies for two years butzner found a job at iron age magazine a 1943 article on economic decline in scranton was well-publicized and led the murray corporation to locate a warplane factory there encouraged by this success butzner petitioned the war production board to support more operations in scranton experiencing discrimination at iron age she also advocated for equal pay for women and for workers  right to unionize
amerika
she became a feature writer for the office of war information and then a reporter for amerika a publication of the us state department while working there she met robert hyde jacobs jr a columbia-educated architect who was designing warplanes for grumman butzner and jacobs married in 1944 together they had two sons james and ned and a daughter burgin they bought a three-story building at 555 hudson st jane continued to write for amerika after the war while robert left grumman and resumed work as an architect
the jacobses rejected the rapidly growing suburbs as  parasitic  choosing instead to remain in greenwich village they renovated their new house in the middle of a mixed residential and commercial area and created a garden in the backyard
working for the state department during mccarthyism jacobs received a questionnaire regarding her political beliefs and loyalties jacobs was anti-communist and had left the federal workers union because of its apparent communist sympathies nevertheless she was pro-union and purportedly appreciated the writing of saul alinsky  therefore she was under suspicion on march 25 1952 jacobs delivered a now-famous response to conrad e snow chairman of the loyalty security board at the united states department of state in her foreword to her answer she said 
architectural forum
jacobs left amerika in 1952 when it announced that it would relocate to washington dc she found a well-paying job at architectural forum published by henry luce of time inc after early success on the job jacobs began to take assignments on urban planning and  urban blight  in 1954 she was assigned to cover a development in philadelphia designed by edmund bacon although her editors expected a positive story jacobs criticized bacon s project reacting against the apparent lack of care shown for the poor african americans who were directly affected when bacon showed jacobs examples of undeveloped and developed blocks she was upset to find that  development  seemed to end active community life on the street when jacobs returned to the offices of architectural forum she began to question the 1950s consensus on urban planning
in 1955 jacobs met william kirk an episcopal minister who worked in east harlem kirk came to the architectural forum offices to describe the impact that  revitalization  had on east harlem and he introduced jacobs to the neighborhood
in 1956 jacobs delivered a lecture at harvard university standing in for douglas haskell of architectural forum she addressed leading architects urban planners and intellectuals  including lewis mumford  speaking on the topic of east harlem she urged this audience to  respect   in the deepest sense   strips of chaos that have a weird wisdom of their own not yet encompassed in our concept of urban order  contrary to her expectations the talk was received with enthusiasm but it also marked her as a threat to established urban planners real estate owners and developers architectural forum printed the speech that year along with photos of east harlem
rockefeller foundation and death and life of great american cities
after reading the text of her harvard speech william h whyte invited jacobs to write a piece for fortune magazine the resulting piece  downtown is for people  appeared in a 1958 issue of fortune and marked her first public criticism of robert moses her stance - particularly her criticism of the lincoln center - was not popular with supporters of urban renewal at architectural forum and fortune it particularly outraged c d jackson the publisher of fortune who demanded of whyte over the phone   who is this crazy dame  
the fortune piece brought jacobs to the attention of chadbourne gilpatric then associate director of the humanities division at the rockefeller foundation the foundation had moved aggressively into urban topics with a recent award to the massachusetts institute of technology for studies of urban aesthetics that would culminate in the publication of kevin a lynch s image of the city in may 1958 gilpatric invited jacobs to begin serving as a reviewer for grant proposals later that year the rockefeller foundation awarded a grant to jacobs to produce a critical study of city planning and urban life in the us  from the mid-1950s to the mid-1960s the foundation s humanities division sponsored an  urban design studies  research program of which jacobs was the best known grantee  gilpatric encouraged jacobs to  explor the field of urban design to look for ideas and actions which may improve thinking on how the design of cities might better serve urban life including cultural and humane value  affiliating with the new school  then called the new school for social research  she spent three years conducting research and writing drafts in 1961 random house published the product of her research  the death and life of great american cities
the death and life of great american cities remains one of the most influential books in the history of american city planning it introduces terms like  social capital   mixed primary uses  and  eyes on the street  which became popular in urban design sociology and other fields jacobs painted a devastating picture of the entire profession of city planning labeling it a pseudoscience this led to angry responses from various rich and powerful men jacobs was criticized as a  militant dame  and a  housewife   an amateur who had no right to interfere with an established discipline her book was also criticized from the left for leaving out race and accepting gentrification
in 1962 she gave up her position at architectural forum to become a full-time author and mother in addition to her local politics she was a notable opponent of the vietnam war and marched on the pentagon in october 1967 she criticized the construction of the world trade center as a disaster for manhattan s waterfront
struggle for greenwich village
during the 1950s and 1960s her own home neighborhood of greenwich village was being transformed by developers the expansion of new york university  nyu  and by the urban renewal plans of robert moses moses who had already forced through the cross bronx expressway and other roadways against neighborhood opposition envisioned a freeway referred to as the lower manhattan expressway or  lomex  directly through washington square park his plan funded as  slum clearance  by title i of the housing act of 1949 also called for several blocks to be razed and replaced with upscale high-rises the plan forced 132 families out of their homes and displaced 1,000 small businesses the result was washington square village
jacobs chaired the joint committee to stop the lower manhattan expressway  aka joint emergency committee to close washington square to traffic and other names  which recruited such members as margaret mead eleanor roosevelt lewis mumford charles abrams and william h whyte papers such as the new york times were sympathetic to moses while the newly created village voice covered community rallies and advocated against the expressway the committee succeeded in blocking the project on june 25 1958 the city closed washington square park to traffic and the joint committee held a ribbon tying  not cutting  ceremony jacobs continued to fight the expressway when plans resurfaced in 1962 1965 and 1968 and she became a local hero for her opposition to the project she was arrested by a plainclothes police officer on april 10 1968 at a public hearing during which the crowd had charged the stage and destroyed the stenographer s notes she was accused of inciting a riot criminal mischief and obstructing public administration after months of trials conducted in new york city  to which jacobs commuted from toronto  her charge was reduced to disorderly conduct
a late-1990s public broadcasting service  pbs  documentary series on new york s history devoted a full hour of its fourteen hours to the battle between moses and jacobs although robert caro s highly critical biography of moses the power broker gives only passing mention to this event despite jacobs s strong influence on caro
life in toronto
soon after her arrest in 1968 jacobs moved to toronto eventually settling at 69 albany avenue in the annex from 1971 until her death in 2006 she decided to leave the us in part because she opposed the vietnam war she worried about the fate of her two draft-age sons and she did not want to continue fighting the city of new york she and her husband chose toronto because it was pleasant and offered employment opportunities and they moved to an area of the city that included so many americans avoiding the draft it was called the  american ghetto 
she quickly became a leading figure in her new city and helped stop the proposed spadina expressway a frequent theme of her work was to ask whether we are building cities for people or for cars she was arrested twice during demonstrations she also had considerable influence on the regeneration of the st lawrence neighborhood a housing project regarded as a major success she became a canadian citizen in 1974 and she later told writer james howard kunstler that dual citizenship was not possible at the time implying that her us citizenship was lost
in 1980 she offered an urbanistic perspective on quebec s sovereignty in her book the question of separatism  quebec and the struggle over separation jacobs was an advocate of a province of toronto to separate the city proper from ontario jacobs said  cities to thrive in the 21st century must separate themselves politically from their surrounding areas 
she was selected to be an officer of the order of canada in 1996 for her seminal writings and thought-provoking commentaries on urban development the community and urban sociology section of the american sociological association awarded her its outstanding lifetime contribution award in 2002 in 1997 the city of toronto sponsored a conference titled  jane jacobs  ideas that matter  which led to a book by the same name at the end of the conference the jane jacobs prize was created it includes an annual stipend of  5,000 for three years to be given to  celebrate toronto s original unsung heroes   by seeking out citizens who are engaged in activities that contribute to the city s vitality 
jacobs never shied away from expressing her political support for specific candidates she opposed the 1997 amalgamation of the cities of metro toronto fearing that individual neighborhoods would have less power with the new structure she backed an ecologist tooker gomberg who lost toronto s 2000 mayoralty race and was an adviser to david miller s successful mayoral campaign in 2003 at a time when he was seen as a longshot during the mayoral campaign jacobs helped lobby against the construction of a bridge to join the city s waterfront to toronto city centre airport  tcca  following the election toronto city council s earlier decision to approve the bridge was reversed and bridge construction project was stopped tcca did upgrade the ferry service and the airport is still in operation as of 2015
jacobs was also active in a fight against a plan of royal st george s college  an established school very close to jacobs  long-time residence in toronto s annex district  to reconfigure its facilities jacobs suggested not only that the redesign be stopped but also the school be forced from the neighborhood entirely although toronto council initially rejected the school s plans the decision was later reversed   and the project was given the go-ahead by the ontario municipal board  omb  when opponents failed to produce credible witnesses and tried to withdraw from the case during the hearing
she also had an influence on vancouver s urban planning jacobs has been called  the mother of vancouverism  referring to that city s use of her  density done well  philosophy
jacobs died in toronto western hospital aged 89 on april 25 2006 apparently of a stroke she was survived by a brother james butzner  d 2009   her two sons james and ned of vancouver and a daughter burgin jacobs  by two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren upon her death her family s statement noted 
legacy
jacobs is credited along with lewis mumford with inspiring the new urbanist movement she has been characterized as a major influence on decentralist  and radical centrist thought she discussed her legacy in an interview with reason magazine
while jacobs saw her greatest legacy to be her contributions to economic theory it is in the realm of urban planning that she has had her most extensive impact her observations about the ways in which cities function revolutionized the urban planning profession and discredited many accepted planning models that dominated mid-century planning the influential harvard economist edward glaeser known for his work on urban studies acknowledged  that jane jacobs  1960s  had been prescient in attacking moses for  replacing well-functioning neighborhoods with le corbusier-inspired towers  glaeser agreed that these housing projects proved to be moses  greatest failures  moses spent millions and evicted tens of thousands to create buildings that became centers of crime poverty and despair 
she was also famous for introducing concepts such as the  ballet of the sidewalk  and  eyes on the street  a reference to what would later be known as natural surveillance the concept had a huge influence on planners and architects such as oscar newman who operationalized the idea through a series of studies that would culminate in his defensible space theory jacobs s and newman s work would go on to impact american housing policy through the hope vi program an effort by the united states department of housing and urban development to demolish the high-rise public housing projects so reviled by jacobs and to replace them with low-rise mixed-income housing
through her life she fought to alter the way in which city development was approached by arguing that cities were living beings and ecosystems she advocated ideas such as  mixed use  development and bottom-up planning furthermore her harsh criticisms of  slum clearing  and  high-rise housing  projects were instrumental in discrediting these once universally supported planning practices
jacobs is remembered as being an advocate for the mindful development of cities and leaving  a legacy of empowerment for citizens to trust their common sense and become advocates for their place 
despite the fact that jacobs mainly focused on new york her arguments have been identified as universal for instance her opposition against the demolition of urban neighbourhoods for projects of urban renewal had  special resonance  in melbourne australia in melbourne in the 1960s resident associations fought against large-scale high-rise housing projects of the housing commission of victoria which they argued had little regard for the impact on local communities
jacobs fought an uphill battle against dominant trends of planning despite the united states remaining very much a suburban nation the work of jacobs has contributed to city living being rehabilitated and revitalized because of her ideas today many distressed urban neighbourhoods are more likely to be gentrified than cleared for redevelopment
samuel r delany s book times square red times square blue relies heavily on the death and life of great american cities in its analysis of the nature of social relations within the realm of urban studies
jane jacobs days
after jacobs  death in april 2006 new york city mayor michael bloomberg announced a jane jacobs day held on june 28 2006 the city of toronto proclaimed her birthday the following year may 4 2007 as jane jacobs day
jane s walks
in connection with jane jacobs day in toronto two dozen free neighborhood walks in the city were offered that weekend  may 5 2007  as an active memorial to jacobs and were dubbed jane s walks a jane s walk event was later held in new york on september 29 and 30 2007 in 2008 the event spread to eight cities and towns across canada and by 2015 jane s walks were taking place in 189 cities in 36 countries on six continents the interpretive walks typically apply ideas jacobs identified or espoused to local areas which are explored on foot and sometimes by bicycle the walks normally take place in early may on or close to her may 4 birthday walks are organized and led by local volunteers coordinated by a headquarters office in toronto there are more than 200 walks offered in toronto alone in 2016 taking place may 6 7 and 8
exhibitions
in 2016 to mark the 100th anniversary of jacobs  birth a toronto gallery is staging  jane at home  an exhibition running from april 29 to may 8 curated by jane s son jim jacobs it offers glimpses of her home life where she also worked her toronto living room is represented based on the one at her albany avenue house in the annex where she often spoke with noted thinkers and political leaders including marshall mcluhan paul martin and the queen of the netherlands on display are her typewriter original manuscripts rediscovered photographs and personal mementos the exhibit includes furniture from previous homes in new york  her dining room is set up  and from scranton pennsylvania
in 2007 the municipal art society of new york partnered with the rockefeller foundation to host an exhibit focusing on  jane jacobs and the future of new york  which opened at the mas in september that year the exhibit aimed to educate the public on her writings and activism and used tools to encourage new generations to become active in issues involving their own neighborhoods an accompanying exhibit publication includes essays and articles by such architecture critics artists activists and journalists as malcolm gladwell reverend billy robert neuwirth tom wolfe thomas de monchaux and william mcdonough many of these contributors participated in a series of panel discussions on  jane jacobs and the future of new york 
jane jacobs medal
as a tribute to jacobs the rockefeller foundation which had awarded jacobs grants in the 1950s and 1960s announced on february 9 2007 the creation of the jane jacobs medal  to recognize individuals who have made a significant contribution to thinking about urban design specifically in new york city  recipients 
the canadian urban institute offers an award in jacobs  name the jane jacobs lifetime achievement award to recognize a person  who has had significant impact on the health of their region consistent with jane jacob s belief that successful cities foster a place-based community-centred approach

other honors
jacobs received the second vincent scully prize from the national building museum in 2000
criticism
the planners and developers that she fought in order to preserve the west village were among those who initially criticised her ideas robert moses has generally been identified as her archrival during this period since then jacobs  ideas have been analysed many times often in regard to the outcomes that their influences have produced
in places like the west village the factors that she argued would maintain economic and cultural diversity have instead led to gentrification and some of the most expensive real estate in the world her own home sold in the 2000s for more than  3 million arguably her own white-collar family s conversion of an old candy shop into a home was indicative of the gentrifying trend that would continue under the influence of jacobs s ideas
however gentrification was also caused by  the completely unexpected influx of affluent residents back into the inner city  the extent to which her ideas facilitated this phenomenon was at the time unimaginable for example she advocated the preservation of older buildings specifically because their lack of economic value made them affordable for poor people in this respect she saw them as  guarantors of social diversity   klemek 2011 76  that many of these older structures have increased in economic value solely due to their age was implausible in 1961 issues of gentrification have dominated criticism of jane jacobs  planning ideas but her concepts have also been criticised more broadly for example although her ideas of planning were praised at times as  universal  they were criticized as inapplicable when a city grows from one million to ten million  as has happened many times in developing nations  such arguments suggest that the ideas apply only to cities with similar issues to those of new york where jacobs developed many of her ideas
economist tyler cowen has criticized her ideas for not addressing problems of scale or infrastructure and suggests that economists disagree with some of her approaches to development
works
jane jacobs spent her life studying cities her books include 
the death and life of great american cities
the death and life of great american cities is her single-most influential book and possibly the most influential book on urban planning and cities widely read by both planning professionals and the general public the book is a strong critique of the urban renewal policies of the 1950s which she claimed destroyed communities and created isolated unnatural urban spaces jacobs advocated the abolition of zoning laws and restoration of free markets in land which would result in dense mixed-use neighborhoods and frequently cited new york city s greenwich village as an example of a vibrant urban community
robert caro has cited it as the strongest influence on the power broker his pulitzer-winning biography of robert moses though caro does not mention jacobs by name even once in the book despite jacobs  battles with moses over his proposed lower manhattan expressway caro reportedly cut a chapter about jacobs due to his book s length
beyond the practical lessons in city design and planning that death and life offers the theoretical underpinnings of the work challenge the modern development mindset jane jacobs defends her positions with common sense and anecdotes
the economy of cities
the thesis of this book is that cities are the primary drivers of economic development her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement import replacement occurs when a city begins to locally produce goods that it formerly imported eg tokyo bicycle factories replacing tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure skills and production jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement thus producing a positive cycle of growth
in an interview with bill steigerwald in reason magazine jacobs said that if she is remembered for being a great intellectual she will be remembered not for her work concerning city planning but for the discovery of import replacement critics erroneously claim that her ideas parrot the idea of import substitution advanced earlier by scholars such as andre gunder frank import substitution was a national economic theory implying that if a nation substituted its imports with national production the nation would become wealthier whereas jacob s idea is entirely about cities and could be called urban import substitution however even this would lead to confusion since in practice import substitution in india and latin america were government subsidized and mandated whereas jacobs  concept of import replacement is a free market process of discovery and division of labor within a city
in the second part of the book jacobs argues that cities preceded agriculture she argues that in cities trade in wild animals and grains allowed for the initial division of labor necessary for the discovery of husbandry and agriculture  these discoveries then moved out of the city due to land competition another interpretation of history generally and erroneously considered to be contradictory to jacobs  is supported by marxist archaeologist vere gordon childe and in recent times by another historical materialist charles keith maisels these writers argue that agriculture preceded cities the apparent opposition between childe and jacobs theories rests in their definition of  city   civilization  or  urban  childe like other materialists like maisels or henri lefebvre defines  urban  or  civilization  as synoecism as a literate socially stratified monolithic political community whereas as one can see from the economy of cities or from cities and the wealth of nations jacobs defines the city purely along the lines of geographically dense trade giving way to entrepreneurial discovery and subsequent improvements in the division of labor without the requirements of literacy monumental building or the signs of specialized civil and armed forces  cities  can be accurately be interpreted to exists thousands of years before when childe and maisels place them however jacobs  definition is supposition since  city  is defined simply as a large town or  a large human settlement  indicating permanence the earliest remains of mankind uncovered by archaeologists do not give us more information other than they were hunter-gatherers as there is no evidence yet of farming or settlement implying nomadic lifestyles until further discoveries are found
the question of separatism  quebec and the struggle over sovereignty
the question of separatism incorporated and expanded jacobs  presentation of the 1979 massey lectures entitled canadian cities and sovereignty-association it was published in 1980 and reprinted in 2011 with a previously unpublished 2005 interview with robin philpot on the subject in which she evokes the relative overlooking of that book among her usual readership this was in fact the first time she was requested to discuss it in an interview columnist richard gwyn advanced that while not openly criticizing her english-speaking canadians readers thought she did not understood how canadian politics worked and that she was not being helpful in a time of distress for national unity  the 1980 referendum was just defeated by a vote of 60   the question of separatism was also not mentioned in the bibliography of her 2006 obituary in the the globe and mail 
jacobs  book advances the view that quebec s eventual independence is best for montreal toronto the rest of canada and the world  and that such independence can be achieved peacefully as precedent she cites norway s secession from sweden and how it enriched both nations the origins of the contemporary secessionist-movement in the quiet revolution are examined along with canada s historical reliance on natural resources and foreign-owned manufacturing for its own economic development jacobs asserts that such an approach is colonial and hence backward citing by example canada buying its skis and furniture from norway or norwegian-owned factories in canada the latter procedure being a product of canadian tariffs designed specifically to foster such factories the relevant public views of ren  l vesque claude ryan and then prime minister pierre trudeau are also critically analyzed an example being their failure to recognize that two respective independent currencies are essential to the success of an independent quebec and a smaller resultant canada an issue that is central to her book jacobs stresses the need for montreal to continue developing its leadership of qu b cois culture but that such a need can ultimately never be fulfilled by montreal s increasing tendencies toward regional-city status tendencies foretelling economic political and cultural subservience to english-speaking toronto such an outcome jacobs believed would in the long run doom quebec s independence as much as it would hinder canada s own future she concludes with her observation that the popular equating of political secession with political and economic failure is the result of the enlightenment which perceived nature as a force for  standardization uniformity universality and immutability  since then naturalists and their readers have gradually realized that nature is a force for diversity and that  diversity itself is of the essence of excellence  the right kind of secession jacobs states can lead to the right kind of diversity and quebec and canada are capable of both and must achieve both to survive
cities and the wealth of nations
cities and the wealth of nations attempts to do for economics what the death and life of great american cities did for modern urban planning though it has not received the same critical attention beginning with a concise treatment of classical economics this book challenges one of the fundamental assumptions of the greatest economists classical  and neo-classical  economists consider the nation-state to be the main player in macroeconomics jacobs argues that it is not the nation-state rather it is the city which is the true player in this worldwide game she restates the idea of import replacement from her earlier book the economy of cities while speculating on the further ramifications of considering the city first and the nation second or not at all
systems of survival
systems of survival  a dialogue on the moral foundations of commerce and politics moves outside of the city studying the moral underpinnings of work as with her other work she used an observational approach this book is written as a platonic dialogue it appears that she  as described by characters in her book  took newspaper clippings of moral judgements related to work collected and sorted them to find that they fit two patterns of moral behaviour that were mutually exclusive she calls these two patterns  moral syndrome a  or commercial moral syndrome and  moral syndrome b  or guardian moral syndrome she claims that the commercial moral syndrome is applicable to business owners scientists farmers and traders similarly she claims that the guardian moral syndrome is applicable to government charities hunter-gatherers and religious institutions she also claims that these moral syndromes are fixed and do not fluctuate over time
it is important to stress that jane jacobs is providing a theory about the morality of work and not all moral ideas moral ideas that are not included in her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes
jane jacobs goes on to describe what happens when these two moral syndromes are mixed showing the work underpinnings of the mafia and communism and what happens when new york subway police are paid bonuses here   reinterpreted slightly as a part of the larger analysis
the nature of economies
the nature of economies a dialog between friends concerning the premise   human beings exist wholly within nature as part of the natural order in every respect   p ix  argues that the same principles underlie both ecosystems and economies   development and co-development through differentiations and their combinations  expansion through diverse multiple uses of energy  and self-maintenance through self-refueling   p 82 
jacobs  characters discuss the four methods by which  dynamically stable systems  may evade collapse   bifurcations  positive-feedback loops  negative-feedback controls  and emergency adaptations   p 86  their conversations also cover the  double nature of fitness for survival   traits to avoid destroying one s own habitat as well as success in competition to feed and breed p 119  and unpredictability including the butterfly effect characterized in terms of multiplicity of variables as well as disproportional response to cause and self-organization where  a system can be making itself up as it goes along   p 137 
through the dialogue jacobs  characters explore and examine the similarities between the functioning of ecosystems and economies topics include environmental and economic development growth and expansion and how economies and environments keep themselves alive through  self-refueling  jacobs also comments on the nature of economic and biological diversity and its role in the development and growth of the two kinds of systems
the book is infused with many real-world economic and biological examples which help keep the book  down to earth  and comprehensible if dense concepts are furnished with both economic and biological examples showing their coherence in both worlds
one particularly interesting insight is the creation of  something from nothing    an economy from nowhere in the biological world free energy is given through sunlight but in the economic world human creativity and natural resources supply this free energy or at least starter energy another interesting insight is the creation of economic diversity through the combination of different technologies for example the typewriter and television as inputs and outputs of a computer system  this can lead to the creation of  new species of work 
dark age ahead
published in 2004 by random house in dark age ahead jacobs argued that  north american  civilization showed signs of spiral of decline comparable to the collapse of the roman empire her thesis focused on  five pillars of our culture that we depend on to stand firm  which can be summarized as the nuclear family  but also community  education science representational government and taxes and corporate and professional accountability as the title suggests her outlook was far more pessimistic than in her previous books however in the conclusion she wrote that  at a given time it is hard to tell whether forces of cultural life or death are in the ascendancy is suburban sprawl with its murders of communities and wastes of land time and energy a sign of decay  or is rising interest in means of overcoming sprawl a sign of vigor and adaptability in north american culture  arguably either could turn out to be true  as suggested by the title jacobs was not optimistic about the future when writing this book
orthodox urbanism
jane jacobs says in her work the death and life of great american cities that the sources of orthodox urbanism are
