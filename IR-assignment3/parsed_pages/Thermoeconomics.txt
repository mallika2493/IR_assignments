thermoeconomics - wikipedia
thermoeconomics also referred to as biophysical economics is a school of heterodox economics that applies the laws of thermodynamics to economic theory the term  thermoeconomics  was coined in 1962 by american engineer myron tribus thermoeconomics can be thought of as the statistical physics of economic value


basis
thermoeconomics is based on the proposition that the role of energy in biological evolution should be defined and understood not through the second law of thermodynamics but in terms of such economic criteria as productivity efficiency and especially the costs and benefits  or profitability  of the various mechanisms for capturing and utilizing available energy to build biomass and do work
thermodynamics
thermoeconomists maintain that human economic systems can be modeled as thermodynamic systems then based on this premise theoretical economic analogs of the first and second laws of thermodynamics are developed in addition the thermodynamic quantity exergy ie measure of the useful work energy of a system is one measure of value
alternately the existence of thermodynamic correspondences arises directly  ie is not a-priori constructed  in bounded-rational potential games in two different ways  from a dynamical equilibrium or from a constrained maximum information-entropy equilibrium
economic systems
thermoeconomists argue that economic systems always involve matter energy entropy and information moreover the aim of many economic activities is to achieve a certain structure in this manner thermoeconomics applies the theories in non-equilibrium thermodynamics in which structure formations called dissipative structures form and information theory in which information entropy is a central construct to the modeling of economic activities in which the natural flows of energy and materials function to create scarce resources in thermodynamic terminology human economic activity may be described as a dissipative system which flourishes by consuming free energy in transformations and exchange of resources goods and services
