ethnobiology - wikipedia
ethnobiology is the scientific study of the way living things are treated or used by different human cultures it studies the dynamic relationships between people biota and environments from the distant past to the immediate present
 people-biota-environment  interactions around the world are documented and studied through time across cultures and across disciplines in a search for valid reliable answers to two  defining  questions   how and in what ways do human societies use nature and how and in what ways do human societies view nature  


history
beginnings  15th century 19th century 
naturalists have been interested in local biological knowledge since the time europeans started colonising the world from the 15th century onwards paul sillitoe wrote that 
local biological knowledge collected and sampled over these early centuries significantly informed the early development of modern biology 
phase i  1900s 1940s 
ethnobiology itself as a distinctive practice only emerged during the 20th century as part of the records then being made about other peoples and other cultures as a practice it was nearly always ancillary to other pursuits when documenting others  languages folklore and natural resource use roy ellen commented that 
this  first phase  in the development of ethnobiology as a practice has been described as still having an essentially utilitarian purpose often focusing on identifying those  native  plants animals and technologies of some potential use and value within increasingly dominant western economic systems
phase ii  1950s 1970s 
arising out of practices in phase i  above  came a  second phase  in the development of  ethnobiology  with researchers now striving to better document and better understand how other peoples  themselves  conceptualise and categorise  the natural world around them in sillitoe s words 
this  second  phase is marked 
present  1980s 2000s 
by the turn of the 21st century ethnobiological practices research and findings have had a significant impact and influence across a number of fields of biological inquiry including ecology conservation biology development studies and political ecology
the society of ethnobiology advises on its web page 
ethnobiology has come out from its place as an ancillary practice in the shadows of other core pursuits to arise as a whole field of inquiry and research in its own right  taught within many tertiary institutions and educational programmes around the world  with its own methods manuals its own readers and its own textbooks
subjects of inquiry
usage
all societies make use of the biological world in which they are situated but there are wide differences in use informed by perceived need available technology and the culture s sense of morality and sustainability ethnobiologists investigate what lifeforms are used for what purposes the particular techniques of use the reasons for these choices and symbolic and spiritual implications of them
taxonomy
different societies divide the living world up in different ways ethnobiologists attempt to record the words used in particular cultures for living things from the most specific terms  analogous to species names in linnean biology  to more general terms  such as  tree  and even more generally  plant   they also try to understand the overall structure or hierarchy of the classification system  if there is one  there is ongoing debate as to whether there must always be an implied hierarchy
cosmological moral and spiritual significance
societies invest themselves and their world with meaning partly through their answers to questions like  how did the world happen    how and why did people come to be    what are proper practices and why   and  what realities exist beyond or behind our physical experience   understanding these elements of a societies  perspective is important to cultural research in general and ethnobiologists investigate how a societies  view of the natural world informs and is informed by them
traditional ecological knowledge
in order to live effectively in a given place a people needs to understand the particulars of their environment and many traditional societies have complex and subtle understandings of the places in which they live ethnobiologists seek to share in these understandings subject to ethical concerns regarding intellectual property and cultural appropriation
cross-cultural ethnobiology
in cross cultural ethnobiology research two or more communities participate simultaneously this enables the researcher to compare how a bio-resource is used by different communities
subdisciplines
ethnobotany
ethnozoology
ethnoecology
other disciplines
studies and writings within ethnobiology draw upon research from fields including archaeology geography linguistics systematics population biology ecology cultural anthropology ethnography pharmacology nutrition conservation and sustainable development
ethics
through much of the history of ethnobiology its practitioners were primarily from dominant cultures and the benefit of their work often accrued to the dominant culture with little control or benefit invested in the indigenous peoples whose practice and knowledge they recorded
just as many of those indigenous societies work to assert legitimate control over physical resources such as traditional lands or artistic and ritual objects many work to assert legitimate control over their intellectual property
in an age when the potential exists for large profits from the discovery of for example new food crops or medicinal plants modern ethnobiologists must consider intellectual property rights the need for informed consent the potential for harm to informants and their  debt to the societies in which they work 
furthermore these questions must be considered not only in light of western industrialized nations  common understanding of ethics and law but also in light of the ethical and legal standards of the societies from which the ethnobiologist draws information
