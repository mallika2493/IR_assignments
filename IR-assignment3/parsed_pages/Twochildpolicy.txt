two-child policy - wikipedia
a two-child policy is a government-imposed limit of two children allowed per family or the payment of government subsidies only to the first two children it has previously been used in vietnam in british hong kong in the 1970s citizens were also highly encouraged to have two children as a limit  although it was not mandated by law  and it was used as part of the region s family planning strategies


china
during the 1970s chinese citizens were encouraged to have only one child the ongoing cultural revolution and the strain it placed on the nation were large factors during this time the birth rate dropped from nearly 6 children per woman to just under 3  the colloquial term  births per woman  is usually formalized as the total fertility rate  tfr  a technical term in demographic analysis meaning the average number of children that would be born to a woman over her lifetime if she were to experience the exact current age-specific fertility rates through her lifetime 
as china s youngest generation  born under the one-child policy which first became a requirement for most couples in 1979  came of age for formation of the next generation a single child would be left with having to provide support for his or her two parents and four grandparents in response to this issue by 2009 all provinces allowed couples to have two children if both parents were only children themselves after a policy change of the chinese government in late 2013 most chinese provinces further relaxed the policy in 2014 by allowing families to have two children if one of the parents is an only child
moreover in accordance with prc s affirmative action policies towards ethnic minorities all non-han ethnic groups were subjected to different rules and were usually allowed to have two children in urban areas and three or four in rural areas han chinese living in rural areas were often permitted to have two children as exceptions existed if the first child was a daughter because of cases such as these as well as urban couples who simply paid a fine  or  social maintenance fee   to have more children the overall fertility rate of mainland china is in fact closer to two children per family than to one child per family  1.8  in addition since 2012 han chinese in southern xinjiang were allowed to have two children this along with incentives and restrictions against higher muslim uyghur fertility was seen as attempt to counter the threat of uyghur separatism
on october 29 2015 xinhua reported the change in the existing law to a two-child policy citing a statement from the communist party of china the new policy allowing chinese couples to have two children was proposed in order to help address the aging issue in china on december 27 2015 the new law was passed in the session of the national people s congress standing committee which governs country s laws effective from january 1 2016
under the new rule couples still have to ask permission to have a second child
hong kong
in british hong kong the eugenics league was founded in 1936 which became the family planning association of hong kong in 1950 the organization provides family planning advice sex education and birth control services to the general public of hong kong in the 1970s due to the rapidly rising population it launched the  two is enough  campaign which reduced the general birth rate through educational means the organization founded the international planned parenthood federation with its counterparts in seven other countries the total fertility rate in hong kong is currently 1.04 children per woman one of the lowest in the world
iran
iranian authorities encouraged families in iran not to have more than two children when conducting family planning in iran from early 1990s to late 2006 iran s government  declared that islam favored families with only two children  as one historian put it when the family planning program initiated where iran s health ministry launched a nationwide campaign and introduced contraceptives - pills condoms iuds implants tubal ligations and vasectomies starting in 2006 the government s population control policy changed when ahmadinejad called for reversal of iran s existing policy of  two children is enough  and later in 2012 ayatollah khamenei also stated that iran s contraceptive policy made sense 20 years ago  but its continuation in later years was wrong  scientific and experts studies show that we will face population aging and reduction  in population  if the birth-control policy continues 
singapore
in singapore the two-child policy until the 1980s was called  stop at two 
united kingdom
in july 2007 the think tank optimum population trust  now population matters  advocated what the daily mail described as a   two-child  policy  to combat population increases and climate change in the united kingdom the article stated 
in october 2012 the conservative party s proposed policy of only paying child benefit for the first two children of unemployed parents has been described as a  two-child policy  and has been fronted by the secretary of state for work and pensions and former leader of the conservative party iain duncan smith
vietnam
vietnam has had a population policy for over 50 years it was launched by the vietnamese government in the early 1960s in north vietnam and continues in a modified form today throughout united vietnam the policy emphasizes the official family-size goal to be m t ho c hai con which means  one or two children 
in 2014 vietnam had an estimated population of 92.5 million people which represented 1.28  of the total world population currently the total fertility rate of vietnam is 1.8  births per woman  which is below the replacement-level fertility of 2.1 the rate  at which a population exactly replaces itself from one generation to the next  according to the world resources institute
history
from 1954 to 1975 vietnam was split into north and south vietnam along the 17th parallel with separate governments and policies in each region north vietnam became the democratic republic of vietnam and had a communist government whereas south vietnam became the republic of vietnam and was more aligned with the united states and other western nations in 1963 north vietnam began a policy advocating a two-or-three-child norm due to the sharp population increase of the largely poor and rural population vietnam s family planning policy was developed before those of other countries such as china and india the government used a system of information education communication  iec  campaign and publicly accessible contraceptives to curb the population after the reunification of north and south vietnam in 1975 under the communist party there was a governmental effort to extend the policies of the north to the rest of vietnam which extended into the next decade though the government of the republic of vietnam adopted family planning in general as the official state policy inadequate medical facilities prevented the policy from being effectively implemented
in 1982 the vietnam government practiced various family planning measures including the allowance of use of abortion and the creation of the national committee for population and family planning after 1983 each family was required to limit the number of children to two in 1985 the government increased incentives such as contraceptives and abortion acceptors and disincentives such as penalties for violations in family planning
in 1986 the party implemented the renovation    i m i  policy which completely reversed the communist party economy to implement capitalistic market ideals the aims of the renovation policy were to end vietnam s economic isolation increase competitiveness and raise living standards in an attempt to effectively develop the population socioeconomically and increase the standard of living within the population the vietnam government emphasized the need to contain birth rates in 1988 council of ministers issued an in-depth family planning policy adding additional restrictions beyond the previous restriction of keeping the maximum number of children per household to two the detailed one-or-two-child policy of vietnam was established nine years after china s one-child policy was implemented and elements of china s policy are reflected in vietnam s such as the emphasis on marrying later postponing childbearing age  22-years of age or older for women and 24-years of age or older for men  and spacing out birth of children  3 5 years apart  the state was required to supply free birth control devices  such as intrauterine loops condoms and birth control pills  and to provide facilities for individuals who are eligible for abortions furthermore if families did not comply with the two-child policy they were required to pay high fees and were unable to move into urban centers
in 1993 the vietnamese government issued the first formalization for the unified vietnam of the one-to-two child policy as a mandatory national policy the policy combined advertisements and education to promote a smaller family  so people may enjoy a plentiful and happy life  the vietnamese government explicitly linked the family planning policy with  historical and cultural traditions value structures and development objectives  encouraging a collectivist mindset in which individuals honor the needs of the nation above their own the goal of the policy was to reduce the vietnamese fertility rate to the replacement level of 2.1 by 2015 so that the country could have a stable population during mid-21st century in 1997 the goal was accelerated to reach the replacement level by 2005 and the government subsequently integrated an increased use of abortion as a means to curb population growth
in 2003 the standing parliamentary committee of the national assembly issued the highest legislative document on population titled the population ordinance which restructured the official family planning policy according to the ordinance couples  shall have the right to decide on the time to have babies the number of children and the duration between child births  however shortly after the government implemented the national strategy on population 2001-2010 which again called for decreasing the fertility rate to the replacement level by 2005 this caused controversy as individuals protested the conflicting messages purported by the government in regards to their reproductive rights to address this confusion the government issued resolution 47 in 2005 which stated that  to sustain high economic growth viet nam needs to pursue a population control policy until it has become an industrialized country  however at this time the population had already reached the goal of having a total fertility rate below the replacement level
in 2009 the population ordinance was amended to again restrict the number of children to be one or two children although individuals were allowed to decide the timing and spacing of their births the government is currently drafting a new law on population to replace the population ordinance in 2015 however there is disagreement between policy makers and academics on what should be included in the law
administration
the organizational structure of the two-child policy was housed under different governmental units since its conception in the 1960s as the policy evolved from  initiation in the 1960s-1970s  maturity in the 1980s-1990s  and legalization in the 2000s-2010s  the administration of the population policy also changed from 1961-1983 the population program fell under the population and birth control unit from 1984-2002 it was under the control of national committee for population and family planning from 2003-2006 it was in the jurisdiction of the viet nam commission for population family and children since 2007 the population program has been under the general office for population and family planning
although the policy was advocated on the national level the central government did not utilize specific fines or incentives instead delegating implementation responsibilities to local governments each family was required to have at most two children and local governments were responsible to decide the details of enforcement depending on the specific location district governments charged fines ranging from 60 to 800 kilograms of paddy rice equivalent to the worth of a month to a year s wages for each additional child and additionally women who agreed to be sterilized were given bonuses of 120 to 400 kilograms of rice individuals who did not use contraceptives sometimes had their names announced over the intercom system of the village to shame them into using them whereas individuals who did could be selected to win the labor medal for  good realization of the population-family planning program  the government and large companies also regularly denied people who violated the policy of their salaries promotions and sometimes even their jobs
current status
currently the effective population policy is the revised 2009 population ordinance which states that  each couple and individual has the right and responsibility to participate in the campaigns on population and family planning reproductive health care   i  decide time and birth spacing   ii  have one or two children exceptional cases to be determined by the government  thus individuals have control over the timing and spacing of the births of their children but are still restricted in the number of children they are allowed to have furthermore later that year chief executive tr  ng t n san stressed the need for continued diligence in population control and stated that the population of vietnam should be 100 million people by 2020 and suggested that a new comprehensive law on population be introduced to the government by 2015
effects of this policy
the total fertility rate in vietnam dropped from 5.6 in 1979 to 3.2 by 1993 suggesting the two-child policy was successful in containing the population growth according to one demographic model the bongaarts  model of components of fertility high rates of contraceptive use and of induced abortion are plausible explanations for the decreased fertility rate furthermore because of this policy the population has fundamentally changed their ideas of the family in 1988 the inter-censal demographic and health survey found that parents wanted an average of 3.3 children and in 1994 they found that the ideal number of children fell to 2.8
however the reported findings differ depending on the fertility model utilized and on the particular research study cited the united nations economic and social council for asia and the pacific found that the average number in household was 3.1 in 1998 in another study conducted by the america-based non-profit non-governmental organization population reference bureau the number found was lower at 2.3 another study published in the worldwide state of the family in 1995 by tran xuan nhi found a contrasting finding that the total fertility rate only dropped slightly and the size of nuclear families experienced only a slight change dipping from 4.8 to 4.7 from 1989 to 1994
there is evidence that son preference exists in vietnam traditionally men oversee and are responsible for household enterprises managing agriculture ancestral worship and carrying on the family name however although the desire for a son is seen in the vietnamese family s fertility practices the desire for more than one son is not families with two daughters are twice as likely to have a third child than families with at least one son presumably with the hopes that this one will be a boy furthermore women who do not have any sons are around 15  less likely to use contraceptives than families who have at least one there were also increased rates of  contraceptive failure  amongst couples who had a son as families secretly removed an iud to bypass the policy in hopes of having a son this is consistent with findings from other east asian countries in which son preference corresponds with a demand for fewer children so that families will have at least one son to maintain the ancestral line
despite the evidence for son preference there is no clear evidence that vietnam s sex ratio at birth is increasing as seen in other east asian countries notably china though evidence is conflicting depending on the source in fact according to the vietnamese census data for 1989 and 1999 the sex ratios of males to females at birth are actually decreasing on the other hand some sources state that the impact of son preference varies by region of vietnam in the north there is a strong relationship between sex bias in fertility decisions and number of male births while in the south this relationship is nonexistent however mothers who pursue certain occupations such as government cadres and farmers are more likely to want a particular sex of child and have higher sex-ratio differences at birth this reflects the pressure for government employees to adhere to the two-child limit and the perceived necessity of males for manual labor in the farm
criticism
although the policy states that  the state will supply free of charge birth control devices to eligible persons who are cadres manual workers civil servants or members of the armed forces and poor persons who register to practice family planning the widespread sale of birth control devices will be permitted to facilitate their use by everybody that needs them  the only modern contraceptive readily available in vietnam is the iud however many women choose not to use it due to the side effects such as increased bleeding back and abdominal pains headache and general weakness thus contraceptive use is low among women under the age of 25 and experts have speculated that  contraceptive use among young women might increase if temporary easy-to-use methods such as the pill and the condom were more accessible for the government to achieve its two-child policy the survey committee recommends increased promotion of the commercial availability of the condom and the pill and strengthening of the government family planning program 
abortion rates in vietnam are unusually high by international standards with a total abortion rate of at least 2.5 abortions per woman generally the abortion rate for young age groups is higher than older age groups due to a limited awareness of contraceptive methods and availability individuals of lower educational levels also have higher abortion rates vietnam also has some of the world s most liberal abortion laws though the vietnamese government is aiming to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies and abortion-related difficulties although sex-selective abortions were banned by the government in 2006 there is evidence that suggests that son preference is associated with a higher likelihood of repeat abortions as women with no sons were significantly less likely to have a repeat abortion compared to women with one son
there are multiple factors influencing vietnam s high abortion rates first because women do not have access to contraceptive methods besides iuds many do not use effective birth control women who have undergone multiple abortions used short-term methods of contraceptives such as condoms and contraceptive pills which are less effective than long-acting contraceptives to which many do not have access secondly due to the higher costs of raising a child in some geographic areas of vietnam abortions have become more acceptable furthermore the era of modernization and development of free-market reforms since the 1980s has led to a rise in premarital and unwanted pregnancy and subsequently increased abortion services additionally the vietnamese government has insufficient alternatives to abortion within the family planning purposes and a lack of post-abortion contraceptive dialogues for families thus experts have suggested providing more diverse long-acting contraceptive alternatives and increasing counseling for families that have experienced an abortion as methods to decrease abortion in vietnam
