industrialisation - wikipedia
industrialisation or industrialization is the period of social and economic change that transforms a human group from an agrarian society into an industrial one involving the extensive re-organisation of an economy for the purpose of manufacturing
as industrial workers  incomes rise markets for consumer goods and services of all kinds tend to expand and provide a further stimulus to industrial investment and economic growth


background
the first transformation to an industrial economy from an agricultural one known as the industrial revolution took place from the mid-18th to early 19th century in certain areas in europe and north america  starting in the netherlands and great britain followed by belgium germany and france characteristics of this early industrialization were technological progress a shift from rural work to industrial labor financial investments in new industrial structure and early developments in class consciousness and theories related to this later commentators have called this the first industrial revolution
the  second industrial revolution  labels the later changes that came about in the mid-19th century after the refinement of the steam engine the invention of the internal combustion engine the harnessing of electricity and the construction of canals railways and electric-power lines the invention of the assembly line gave this phase a boost coal mines steelworks and textile factories replaced homes as the place of work 
by the end of the 20th century east asia had become one of the most recently industrialised regions of the world the brics states  brazil russia india china and south africa  are undergoing the process of industrialization
there is considerable literature on the factors facilitating industrial modernisation and enterprise development
social consequences
urbanisation
the concentration of labour into factories has increased urbanisation and the size of settlements to serve and house the factory workers
workers have to either leave their families or bring them along in order to work in the towns and cities where these industries are found
changes in family structure
the family structure changes with industrialisation the sociologist talcott parsons noted that in pre-industrial societies there is an extended family structure spanning many generations who probably remained in the same location for generations in industrialised societies the nuclear family consisting of only parents and their growing children predominates families and children reaching adulthood are more mobile and tend to relocate to where jobs exist extended family bonds become more tenuous
current situation
currently the  international development community   world bank organisation for economic co-operation and development  oecd  many united nations departments and some other organisations  endorses development policies like water purification or primary education and co-operation amongst third world communities some members of the economic communities do not consider contemporary industrialisation policies as being adequate to the global south  third world countries  or beneficial in the longer term with the perception that it could only create inefficient local industries unable to compete in the free-trade dominated political order which it has created
the relationships among economic growth employment and poverty reduction are complex higher productivity is argued to be leading to lower employment  see jobless recovery  there are differences across sectors whereby manufacturing is less able than the tertiary sector to accommodate both increased productivity and employment opportunities  more than 40  of the world s employees are  working poor  whose incomes fail to keep themselves and their families above the  2-a-day poverty line there is also a phenomenon of deindustrialisation as in the former ussr countries  transition to market economies and the agriculture sector is often the key sector in absorbing the resultant unemployment
