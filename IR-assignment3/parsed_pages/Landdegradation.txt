land degradation - wikipedia
land degradation is a process in which the value of the biophysical environment is affected by a combination of human-induced processes acting upon the land it is viewed as any change or disturbance to the land perceived to be deleterious or undesirable natural hazards are excluded as a cause  however human activities can indirectly affect phenomena such as floods and bush fires
this is considered to be an important topic of the 21st century due to the implications land degradation has upon agronomic productivity the environment and its effects on food security it is estimated that up to 40  of the world s agricultural land is seriously degraded


measures
land degradation is a broad term that can be applied differently across a wide range of scenarios there are four main ways of looking at land degradation and its impact on the environment around it 
a problem with defining land degradation is that what one group of people might view as degradation others might view as a benefit or opportunity for example planting crops at a location with heavy rainfall and steep slopes would create scientific and environmental concern regarding the risk of soil erosion by water yet farmers could view the location as a favourable one for high crop yields
different types
in addition to the usual types of land degradation that have been known for centuries  water wind and mechanical erosion physical chemical and biological degradation  four other types have emerged in the last 50 years 
overall 36 types of land degradation can be assessed all are induced or aggravated by human activities eg sheet erosion silting aridification salinization urbanization etc
causes
land degradation is a global problem largely related to agricultural use causes include 
effects
overcutting of vegetation occurs when people cut forests woodlands and shrublands to obtain timber fuelwood and other products at a pace exceeding the rate of natural regrowth this is frequent in semi-arid environments where fuelwood shortages are often severe
overgrazing is the grazing of natural pastures at stocking intensities above the livestock carrying capacity  the resulting decrease in the vegetation cover is a leading cause of wind and water erosion it is a significant factor in afghanistan the growing population pressure during 1980-1990 has led to decreases in the already small areas of agricultural land per person in six out of eight countries  14  for india and 22  for pakistan 
population pressure also operates through other mechanisms improper agricultural practices for instance occur only under constraints such as the saturation of good lands under population pressure which leads settlers to cultivate too shallow or too steep soils plough fallow land before it has recovered its fertility or attempt to obtain multiple crops by irrigating unsuitable soils
high population density is not always related to land degradation rather it is the practices of the human population that can cause a landscape to become degraded populations can be a benefit to the land and make it more productive than it is in its natural state land degradation is an important factor of internal displacement in many african and asian countries
severe land degradation affects a significant portion of the earth s arable lands decreasing the wealth and economic development of nations as the land resource base becomes less productive food security is compromised and competition for dwindling resources increases the seeds of famine and potential conflict are sown
sensitivity and resilience
sensitivity and resilience are measures of the vulnerability of a landscape to degradation these two factors combine to explain the degree of vulnerability sensitivity is the degree to which a land system undergoes change due to natural forces human intervention or a combination of both resilience is the ability of a landscape to absorb change without significantly altering the relationship between the relative importance and numbers of individuals and species that compose the community it also refers to the ability of the region to return to its original state after being changed in some way the resilience of a landscape can be increased or decreased through human interaction based upon different methods of land-use management land that is degraded becomes less resilient than undegraded land which can lead to even further degradation through shocks to the landscape
climate change
significant land degradation from seawater inundation particularly in river deltas and on low-lying islands is a potential hazard that was identified in a 2007 ipcc report
as a result of sea-level rise from climate change salinity levels can reach levels where agriculture becomes impossible in very low-lying areas
