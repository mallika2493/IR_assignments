an essay on the principle of population - wikipedia
the book an essay on the principle of population was first published anonymously in 1798 but the author was soon identified as thomas robert malthus the book predicted a grim future as population would increase geometrically doubling every 25 years but food production would only grow arithmetically which would result in famine and starvation unless births were controlled the book overlooked potential improvements in farming such as steam-powered machines chemical fertilizers drip irrigation night lighting or genetically modified organisms  gmo 
while it was not the first book on population it was revised for over 28 years and has been acknowledged as the most influential work of its era the historian thomas carlyle referred to malthus  subject of economics as the  dismal science  the book s 6th edition  1826  was independently cited as a key influence by both charles darwin and alfred russel wallace in developing the theory of natural selection
a key portion of the book was dedicated to what is now known as malthus  iron law of population this name itself is retrospective based on the iron law of wages which is the reformulation of malthus  position by ferdinand lassalle who in turn derived the name from goethe s  great eternal iron laws  in das g ttliche this theory suggested that growing population rates would contribute to a rising supply of labour that would inevitably lower wages in essence malthus feared that continued population growth would lend itself to poverty and famine
one immediate impact of malthus s book was that it fueled the debate about the size of the population in the kingdom of great britain and led to  or at least greatly accelerated  the passing of the census act 1800 this act enabled the holding of a national census in england wales and scotland starting in 1801 and continuing every ten years to the present
in 1803 malthus published a major revision to his first edition as the same title second edition  his final version the 6th edition was published in 1826 however in 1830 32 years after the first edition malthus published a condensed version titled a summary view on the principle of population which included remarks about criticisms of the main book


overview
between 1798 and 1826 malthus published six editions of his famous treatise updating each edition to incorporate new material to address criticism and to convey changes in his own perspectives on the subject he wrote the original text in reaction to the optimism of his father and his father s associates  notably rousseau  regarding the future improvement of society malthus also constructed his case as a specific response to writings of william godwin  1756 1836  and of the marquis de condorcet  1743 1794 
malthus regarded ideals of future improvement in the lot of humanity with skepticism considering that throughout history a segment of every human population seemed relegated to poverty he explained this phenomenon by arguing that population growth generally expanded in times and in regions of plenty until the size of the population relative to the primary resources caused distress 
malthus also saw that societies through history had experienced at one time or another epidemics famines or wars  events that masked the fundamental problem of populations overstretching their resource limitations 
the rapid increase in the global population of the past century exemplifies malthus s predicted population patterns  it also appears to describe socio-demographic dynamics of complex pre-industrial societies these findings are the basis for neo-malthusian modern mathematical models of long-term historical dynamics
malthus made the specific prediction that world population would fall below a line going upward from its then current population of one billion adding one billion every 25 years he wrote 
this prediction is illustrated in the chart on the right the chart also illustrates the current un data on world population since 1800 and un projections for future growth to date world population has remained below his predicted line however the current rate of increase since 1955 is over two billion per 25 years more than twice the malthus predicted maximum rate at the same time world hunger has been in decline the highest un projection has population continuing at this rate and surpassing the malthus predicted line this high projection supposes today s growth rate is sustainable to the year 2100 and beyond
proposed solutions
malthus argued that two types of checks hold population within resource limits  positive checks which raise the death rate  and preventive ones which lower the birth rate the positive checks include hunger disease and war  the preventive checks abortion birth control prostitution postponement of marriage and celibacy regarding possibilities for freeing man from these limits malthus argued against a variety of imaginable solutions for example he satirically criticized the notion that agricultural improvements could expand without limit 
he also commented on the notion that francis galton later called eugenics 
in the second and subsequent editions malthus put more emphasis on moral restraint by that he meant the postponement of marriage until people could support a family coupled with strict celibacy  sexual abstinence  until that time  he went so far as to claim that moral restraint on a wide scale was the best means indeed the only means of easing the poverty of the lower classes  this plan appeared consistent with virtue economic gain and social improvement
malthus emphasises the difference between government-supported welfare and public charity he proposed the gradual abolition of poor laws by gradually reducing the number of persons qualifying for relief relief in dire distress would come from private charity he reasoned that poor relief acted against the longer-term interests of the poor by raising the price of commodities and undermining the independence and resilience of the peasant in other words the poor laws tended to  create the poor which they maintain 
it offended malthus that critics claimed he lacked a caring attitude toward the situation of the poor in the 1798 edition his concern for the poor shows in passages such as the following 
in an addition to the 1817 edition he wrote 
some such as william farr and karl marx argued that malthus did not fully recognize the human capacity to increase food supply on this subject however malthus had written   the main peculiarity which distinguishes man from other animals in the means of his support is the power which he possesses of very greatly increasing these means 
on religion
as a christian and a clergyman malthus addressed the question of how an omnipotent and caring god could permit suffering in the first edition of his essay  1798  malthus reasoned that the constant threat of poverty and starvation served to teach the virtues of hard work and virtuous behaviour  had population and food increased in the same ratio it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state  he wrote adding further  evil exists in the world not to create despair but activity 
nevertheless although the threat of poverty could be understood to be a prod to motivate human industry it was not god s will that man should suffer malthus wrote that mankind itself was solely to blame for human suffering 
demographics wages and inflation
malthus wrote of the relationship between population real wages and inflation when the population of laborers grows faster than the production of food real wages fall because the growing population causes the cost of living  ie the cost of food  to go up difficulties of raising a family eventually reduce the rate of population growth until the falling population again leads to higher real wages 
in later editions of his essay malthus clarified his view that if society relied on human misery to limit population growth then sources of misery  eg hunger disease and war termed by malthus  positive checks on population   would inevitably afflict society as would volatile economic cycles on the other hand  preventive checks  to population that limited birthrates such as later marriages could ensure a higher standard of living for all while also increasing economic stability
editions and versions
1st edition
the full title of the first edition of malthus  essay was  an essay on the principle of population as it affects the future improvement of society with remarks on the speculations of mr godwin m condorcet and other writers  the speculations and other writers are explained below
william godwin had published his utopian work enquiry concerning political justice in 1793 with later editions in 1796 and 1798 also of avarice and profusion  1797  malthus  remarks on godwin s work spans chapters 10 through 15  inclusive  out of nineteen godwin responded with of population  1820 
the marquis de condorcet had published his utopian vision of social progress and the perfectibility of man esquisse d un tableau historique des progres de l espirit humain  the future progress of the human mind  in 1794 malthus  remarks on condorcet s work spans chapters 8 and 9
malthus  essay was in response to these utopian visions as he argued 
the  other writers  included robert wallace adam smith richard price and david hume
malthus himself claimed 
chapters 1 and 2 outline malthus  principle of population and the unequal nature of food supply to population growth the exponential nature of population growth is today known as the malthusian growth model this aspect of malthus  principle of population together with his assertion that food supply was subject to a linear growth model would remain unchanged in future editions of his essay note that malthus actually used the terms geometric and arithmetic respectively
chapter 3 examines the overrun of the roman empire by barbarians due to population pressure war as a check on population is examined
chapter 4 examines the current state of populousness of civilized nations  particularly europe  malthus criticises david hume for a  probable error  in his  criteria that he proposes as assisting in an estimate of population 
chapter 5 examines the poor laws of pitt the younger 
chapter 6 examines the rapid growth of new colonies such as the former thirteen colonies of the united states of america
chapter 7 examines checks on population such as pestilence and famine
chapter 8 also examines a  probable error  by wallace  that the difficulty arising from population is at a great distance 
chapters 16 and 17 examine the causes of the wealth of states including criticisms of adam smith and richard price english wealth is compared with chinese poverty
chapters 18 and 19 set out a theodicy to explain the problem of evil in terms of natural theology this views the world as  a mighty process for awakening matter  in which the supreme being acting  according to general laws  created  wants of the body  as  necessary to create exertion  which forms  the reasoning faculty  in this way the principle of population would  tend rather to promote than impede the general purpose of providence 
the 1st edition influenced writers of natural theology such as william paley and thomas chalmers
2nd to 6th editions
following both widespread praise and criticism of his essay malthus revised his arguments and recognized other influences 
the 2nd edition published in 1803  with malthus now clearly identified as the author  was entitled  an essay on the principle of population  or a view of its past and present effects on human happiness  with an enquiry into our prospects respecting the future removal or mitigation of the evils which it occasions 
malthus advised that the 2nd edition  may be considered as a new work  and essentially the subsequent editions were all minor revisions of the 2nd edition these were published in 1806 1807 1817 and 1826
by far the biggest change was in how the 2nd to 6th editions of the essay were structured and the most copious and detailed evidence that malthus presented more than any previous such book on population essentially for the first time malthus examined his own principle of population on a region-by-region basis of world population the essay was organized in four books 
due in part to the highly influential nature of malthus  work  see main article thomas malthus  this approach is regarded as pivotal in establishing the field of demography
the following controversial quote appears in the second edition 
ecologist professor garrett hardin claims that the preceding passage inspired hostile reactions from many critics the offending passage of malthus  essay appeared in the 2nd edition only as malthus felt obliged to remove it
from the 2nd edition onwards   in book iv   malthus advocated moral restraint as an additional and voluntary check on population this included such measures as sexual abstinence and late marriage
as noted by professor robert m young malthus dropped his chapters on natural theology from the 2nd edition onwards also the essay became less of a personal response to william godwin and marquis de condorcet
a summary view
a summary view on the principle of population was published in 1830 the author was identified as rev tr malthus am frs malthus wrote a summary view for those who did not have the leisure to read the full essay and as he put it  to correct some of the misrepresentations which have gone abroad respecting two or three of the most important points of the essay 
a summary view ends with a defense of the principle of population against the charge that it  mpeaches the goodness of the deity and is inconsistent with the letter and spirit of the scriptures

this was malthus  final word on his principle of population he died in 1834
other works that influenced malthus
reception and influence of the essay
personalia
malthus became subject to extreme personal criticism people who knew nothing about his private life criticised him both for having no children and for having too many in 1819 shelley berating malthus as a priest called him  a eunuch and a tyrant  marx repeated the idea adding that malthus had taken the vow of celibacy and called him  superficial   a professional plagiarist   the agent of the landed aristocracy   a paid advocate  and  the principal enemy of the people 
in the 20th century an editor of the everyman edition of malthus claimed that malthus had practised population control by begetting eleven girls in fact malthus fathered two daughters and one son garrett hardin provides an overview of such personal comments
early influence
the position held by malthus as professor at the haileybury training college to his death in 1834 gave his theories some influence over britain s administration of india according to peterson william pitt the younger  in office  1783 1801 and 1804 1806  on reading the work of malthus withdrew a bill he had introduced that called for the extension of poor relief concerns about malthus s theory helped promote the idea of a national population census in the uk government official john rickman became instrumental in the carrying out of the first modern british census in 1801 under pitt s administration in the 1830s malthus s writings strongly influenced whig reforms which overturned tory paternalism and brought in the poor law amendment act of 1834
malthus convinced most economists that even while high fertility might increase the gross output it tended to reduce output per capita david ricardo and alfred marshall admired malthus and so came under his influence early converts to his population theory included william paley despite malthus s opposition to contraception his work exercised a strong influence on francis place  1771 1854  whose neo-malthusian movement became the first to advocate contraception place published his illustrations and proofs of the principles of population in 1822
early responses in the malthusian controversy
william godwin criticized malthus s criticisms of his own arguments in his book on population  1820  other theoretical and political critiques of malthus and malthusian thinking emerged soon after the publication of the first essay on population most notably in the work of robert owen of the essayist william hazlitt  1807  and of the economist nassau william senior and moralist william cobbett true law of population  1845  was by politician thomas doubleday an adherent of cobbett s views
john stuart mill strongly defended the ideas of malthus in his 1848 work principles of political economy  book ii chapters 11 13  mill considered the criticisms of malthus made thus far to have been superficial
the american economist henry charles carey rejected malthus s argument in his magnum opus of 1858 59 the principles of social science carey maintained that the only situation in which the means of subsistence will determine population growth is one in which a given society is not introducing new technologies or not adopting forward-thinking governmental policy and that population regulated itself in every well-governed society but its pressure on subsistence characterized the lower stages of civilization
marxist opposition
another strand of opposition to malthus s ideas started in the middle of the 19th century with the writings of friedrich engels  outlines of a critique of political economy 1844  and karl marx  capital 1867  engels and marx argued that what malthus saw as the problem of the pressure of population on the means of production actually represented the pressure of the means of production on population they thus viewed it in terms of their concept of the reserve army of labour in other words the seeming excess of population that malthus attributed to the seemingly innate disposition of the poor to reproduce beyond their means actually emerged as a product of the very dynamic of capitalist economy
engels called malthus s hypothesis  the crudest most barbarous theory that ever existed a system of despair which struck down all those beautiful phrases about love thy neighbour and world citizenship  engels also predicted that science would solve the problem of an adequate food supply
in the marxist tradition lenin sharply criticized malthusian theory and its neo-malthusian version calling it a  reactionary doctrine  and  an attempt on the part of bourgeois ideologists to exonerate capitalism and to prove the inevitability of privation and misery for the working class under any social system 
in addition many russian philosophers could not easily apply malthus  population theory to russian society in the 1840s in england where malthus lived population was rapidly increasing but suitable agricultural land was limited russia on the other hand had extensive land with agricultural potential yet a relatively sparse population it is possible that this discrepancy between russian and english realities contributed to the rejection of malthus  essay on the principle of population by key russian thinkers another difference which contributed to the confusion and ultimately the rejection of malthus s argument in russia was its cultural basis in english capitalism this political contrast helps explain why it took russia twenty years to publish a review of the work and fifty years to translate malthus s essay
later responses
some 19th-century economists believed that improvements in finance manufacturing and science rendered some of malthus s warnings implausible they had in mind the division and specialization of labour increased capital investment and increased productivity of the land due to the introduction of science into agriculture  note the experiments of justus liebig and of sir john bennet lawes  even in the absence of improvement in technology or of increase of capital equipment an increased supply of labour may have a synergistic effect on productivity that overcomes the law of diminishing returns as american land-economist henry george observed with characteristic piquancy in dismissing malthus   both the jayhawk and the man eat chickens  but the more jayhawks the fewer chickens while the more men the more chickens  in the 20th century those who regarded malthus as a failed prophet of doom included an editor of nature john maddox
economist julian lincoln simon has criticised malthus s conclusions he notes that despite the predictions of malthus and of the neo-malthusians massive geometric population growth in the 20th century did not result in a malthusian catastrophe many factors have been identified as having contributed  general improvements in farming methods  industrial agriculture  mechanization of work  tractors  the introduction of high-yield varieties of wheat and other plants  green revolution  the use of pesticides to control crop pests each played a role
the enviro-sceptic bj rn lomborg presents data showing that the environment has actually improved calories produced per day per capita globally went up 23  between 1960 and 2000 despite the world population doubling during that period
from the opposite angle romanian american economist nicholas georgescu-roegen a progenitor in economics and a paradigm founder of ecological economics has argued that malthus was too optimistic as he failed to recognize any upper limit to the growth of population   only the geometric increase in human numbers is occasionally slowed down  checked  by the arithmetic increase in agricultural produce according to malthus  simple growth model  but some upper limit to population is bound to exist as the total amount of agricultural land   actual as well as potential   on earth is finite georgescu-roegen points out 366 369 georgescu-roegen further argues that the industrialised world s increase in agricultural productivity since malthus  day has been brought about by a mechanisation that has substituted a scarcer source of input for the more abundant input of solar radiation  machinery chemical fertilisers and pesticides all rely on mineral resources for their operation rendering modern agriculture   and the industrialised food processing and distribution systems associated with it   almost as dependent on earth s mineral stock as the industrial sector has always been georgescu-roegen cautions that this situation is a major reason why the carrying capacity of earth   that is earth s capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels   is bound to decrease sometime in the future as earth s finite stock of mineral resources is presently being extracted and put to use 303 political advisor jeremy rifkin and ecological economist herman daly two students of georgescu-roegen have raised similar neo-malthusian concerns about the long run drawbacks of modern mechanised agriculture 136 140  10f
anthropologist eric ross depicts malthus s work as a rationalization of the social inequities produced by the industrial revolution anti-immigration movements the eugenics movement and the various international development movements
social theory
despite use of the term  malthusian catastrophe  by detractors such as economist julian simon  1932 1998  malthus himself did not write that mankind faced an inevitable future catastrophe rather he offered an evolutionary social theory of population dynamics as it had acted steadily throughout all previous history eight major points regarding population dynamics appear in the 1798 essay 
malthusian social theory influenced herbert spencer s idea of the survival of the fittest and the modern ecological-evolutionary social theory of gerhard lenski and marvin harris malthusian ideas have thus contributed to the canon of socioeconomic theory
the first director-general of unesco julian huxley wrote of the crowded world in his evolutionary humanism  1964  calling for a world population policy huxley openly criticised communist and roman catholic attitudes to birth control population control and overpopulation
biology
charles darwin and alfred russel wallace each read and acknowledged the role played by malthus in the development of their own ideas darwin referred to malthus as  that great philosopher  and said   this is the doctrine of malthus applied with manifold force to the animal and vegetable kingdoms for in this case there can be no artificial increase of food and no prudential restraint from marriage  darwin also wrote 
wallace stated 
ronald fisher commented sceptically on malthusianism as a basis for a theory of natural selection fisher did not deny malthus s basic premises but emphasised the role of fecundity  reproductive rate  rather than assume actual conditions would not reduce future births john maynard smith doubted that famine functioned as the great leveller as portrayed by malthus but he also accepted the basic premises 
it was this insight that led darwin to the idea of natural selection and is a major underpinning of the origin of species
later influence
malthusian ideas continue to have considerable influence paul r ehrlich has written several books predicting famine as a result of population increase  the population bomb  1968   population resources environment  issues in human ecology  1970 with anne ehrlich   the end of affluence  1974 with anne ehrlich   the population explosion  1990 with anne ehrlich  in the late 1960s ehrlich predicted that hundreds of millions would die from a coming overpopulation-crisis in the 1970s other examples of applied malthusianism include the 1972 book the limits to growth  published by the club of rome  and the global 2000 report to the then president of the united states jimmy carter science-fiction author isaac asimov issued many appeals for population-control reflecting the perspective articulated by people from robert malthus through paul r ehrlich
ecological economist herman daly has recognized the influence of malthus on his own work on steady-state economics xvi
more recently a school of  neo-malthusian  scholars has begun to link population and economics to a third variable political change and political violence and to show how the variables interact in the early 1980s jack goldstone linked population variables to the english revolution of 1640 1660 and david lempert devised a model of demographics economics and political change in the multi-ethnic country of mauritius goldstone has since modeled other revolutions by looking at demographics and economics and lempert has explained stalin s purges and the russian revolution of 1917 in terms of demographic factors that drive political economy ted robert gurr has also modeled political violence such as in the palestinian territories and in rwanda congo  two of the world s regions of most rapidly growing population  using similar variables in several comparative cases these approaches suggest that political ideology follows demographic forces
malthus sometimes regarded as the founding father of modern demography continues to inspire and influence futuristic visions such as those of k eric drexler relating to space advocacy and molecular nanotechnology as drexler put it in engines of creation  1986    in a sense opening space will burst our limits to growth since we know of no end to the universe nevertheless malthus was essentially right 
the malthusian growth model now bears malthus s name the logistic function of pierre fran ois verhulst  1804 1849  results in the s-curve verhulst developed the logistic growth model favored by so many critics of the malthusian growth model in 1838 only after reading malthus s essay malthus has also inspired retired physics professor albert allen bartlett to lecture over 1,500 times on  arithmetic population and energy  promoting sustainable living and explaining the mathematics of overpopulation
