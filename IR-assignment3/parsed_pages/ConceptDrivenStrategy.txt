concept-driven strategy - wikipedia
a concept-driven strategy is a process for formulating strategy that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy this argues that thinking starts by selecting  explicitly or implicitly  a set of concepts  frames patterns lens principles etc  gained from our past experiences these are used to reflect on whatever happens or is done in the future
concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts  organizing principles  that  works best  for an organisation for example a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be caring world class local evidence based and team based a university might set its strategy as intending to be ranked problem solving online equis and offering pathways a commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be innovative global have visible supply chains agile and market share dominant these strategic concepts make up its statement of intent  or purpose 


background
much of the strategic management literature mutates peter drucker s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose mission and objectives this has been mutated into a call to start with a vision mission and objectives statement there is an alternative approach which focuses on the statement of purpose or intent drucker s example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation s purpose was to create customers that is it was going to use the concept of  customer creation  to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation this was why the corporation existed having one concept is now thought to be insufficient george armitage miller s modified the magical number seven plus or minus two and dialectic suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable
the statement of purpose statement of intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts if a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of decision making criteria the set of concepts that make up the statement of intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner
underlying philosophy
linguistic pragmatism argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception  sensory inputs  these conceptions are represented by concepts like running smiling justice reasoning and agility they are patterns of activity experienced in our past and remembered they can be named by those with language and so shared
bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round
another example would be that we can think of the war in iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security imperialism aggressive capitalism liberation or democracy the concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts
method
the steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are 
other terminology
concept-driven strategy is the name given to an number of similar strategic thinking approaches
generally the term  concept-driven  is used to encourage a focus on the  concepts  being used see concept learning or management concepts
some organisations produce a  statement of intent  with little thought as to the concepts it contains however if it is a short list of concepts high level objectives principles priorities or frames then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements
some organisations produce a  strategic principles  statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis the term  strategic priorities  or  strategic values  are often used in the same way as strategic principles
the literature about  corporate purpose  is also similar to that of strategic intent sometimes purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones if purpose is expressed as a set of concepts then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis
there is a connection between  systems thinking  and concept-driven strategy the churchman ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems rather than a generic set of concepts the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation
there is a military planning approach called  concept-led  the military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders there seems to be very little difference otherwise
in turbulent environments concepts are thought  more flexible than objectives   goals targets  as they provide why certain actions are preferable the purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for  why change  the driver for change objectives are where you end up in complex dynamic situations there may be many acceptable end points many of which cannot be anticipated by planners arguably the only objective is to survive how is explained in the statement of intent
perhaps strangely there is a connection between  metaphor  metaphoric criticism or conceptual metaphor and concept-driven strategy pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors for example to say an organisation is like a machine with cogs or like an adaptive organism is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts
the term  strategic frames  is not common given the extensive literature on frame analysis but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar amos tversky defines a frame as a conception of outcomes
the system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent purpose principles frames or conceptual metaphor are organizing principle s 
also as karl weick explains sensemaking as the process of conceptualising problems concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy
