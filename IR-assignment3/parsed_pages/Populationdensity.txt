population density - wikipedia
population density  in agriculture  standing stock and standing crop  is a measurement of population per unit area or unit volume  it is a quantity of type number density it is frequently applied to living organisms and most of the time to humans it s a key geographical term


biological population densities
population density is population divided by total land area or water volume as appropriate
low densities may cause an extinction vortex and lead to further reduced fertility this is called the allee effect after the scientist who identified it examples of the causes in low population densities include 
human population density
for humans population density is the number of people per unit of area usually quoted per square kilometer or square mile  which may include or exclude for example areas of water or glaciers  commonly this may be calculated for a county city country another territory or the entire world
the world s population is around 7,000,000,000 and earth s total area  including land and water  is 510,000,000 square kilometers  197,000,000 sq mi  therefore the worldwide human population density is around 7,000,000,000   510,000,000   13.7 per km2  35 per sq mi  if only the earth s land area of 150,000,000 km2  58,000,000 sq mi  is taken into account then human population density increases to 47 per km2  120 per sq mile  this includes all continental and island land area including antarctica if antarctica is also excluded then population density rises to over 50 people per km2  over 130 per sq mile  however over half of the earth s land mass consists of areas inhospitable to human habitation such as deserts and high mountains and population tends to cluster around seaports and fresh water sources thus this number by itself does not give any helpful measurement of human population density
several of the most densely populated territories in the world are city-states microstates and dependencies these territories have a relatively small area and a high urbanization level with an economically specialized city population drawing also on rural resources outside the area illustrating the difference between high population density and overpopulation
cities with high population densities are by some considered to be overpopulated though this will depend on factors like quality of housing and infrastructure and access to resources most of the most densely populated cities are in southeast asia though cairo and lagos in africa also fall into this category
city population and especially area are however heavily dependent on the definition of  urban area  used  densities are almost invariably higher for the central city area than when suburban settlements and the intervening rural areas are included as in the areas of agglomeration or metropolitan area the latter sometimes including neighboring cities for instance milwaukee has a greater population density when just the inner city is measured and the surrounding suburbs excluded
in comparison based on a world population of seven billion the world s inhabitants as a loose crowd taking up ten square feet  one square metre  per person  jacobs method  would occupy a space a little larger than delaware s land area
although arithmetic density is the most common way of measuring population density several other methods have been developed to provide a more accurate measure of population density over a specific area
