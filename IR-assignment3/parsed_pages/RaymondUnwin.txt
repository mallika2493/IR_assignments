in 1902 parker and unwin were asked to design a model village at new earswick near york for joseph and benjamin seebohm rowntree and the following year they were given the opportunity to take part in the creation of letchworth  loosely based on the utopian plan of ebenezer howard  when the first garden city company asked them to submit a plan

his demonstration during the great war of the principles of building homes rapidly and economically whilst maintaining satisfactory standards for gardens family privacy and internal spaces gave him great influence over the tudor walters committee and hence indirectly over much inter-war public housing this report marked unwin s definitive break from the traditional  garden city  concept as it proposed that the new developments should be peripheral  satellites  rather than fully-fledged garden cities unwin became technical adviser to the greater london regional planning committee in 1929 and largely wrote its two reports the first published in that year and the second in 1933
