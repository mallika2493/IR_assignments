environmental impact of the petroleum industry - wikipedia
the environmental impact of petroleum is often negative because it is toxic to almost all forms of life and its extraction fuels climate change petroleum commonly referred to as oil is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial and industrial activities


issues
toxicity
crude oil is a mixture of many different kinds of organic compounds many of which are highly toxic and cancer causing  carcinogenic  oil is  acutely lethal  to fish - that is it kills fish quickly at a concentration of 4000 parts per million  ppm   0.4   crude oil and petroleum distillates cause birth defects
benzene is present in both crude oil and gasoline and is known to cause leukaemia in humans the compound is also known to lower the white blood cell count in humans which would leave people exposed to it more susceptible to infections  studies have linked benzene exposure in the mere parts per billion  ppb  range to terminal leukemia hodgkin s lymphoma and other blood and immune system diseases within 5-15 years of exposure 
exhaust
when oil or petroleum distillates are burned  see combustion  usually the combustion is not complete this means that incompletely burned compounds are created in addition to just water and carbon dioxide the other compounds are often toxic to life examples are carbon monoxide and methanol also fine particulates of soot blacken humans  and other animals  lungs and cause heart problems or death soot is cancer causing  carcinogenic 

high temperatures created by the combustion of petroleum cause nitrogen gas in the surrounding air to oxidize creating nitrous oxides nitrous oxides along with sulfur dioxide from the sulfur in the oil combine with water in the atmosphere to create acid rain acid rain causes many problems such as dead trees and acidified lakes with dead fish coral reefs in the world s oceans are killed by acidic water caused by acid rain
acid rain leads to increased corrosion of machinery and structures  large amounts of capital  and to the slow destruction of archaeological structures like the marble ruins in rome and greece
climate change
humans burning large amounts of petroleum create large amounts of co2  carbon dioxide  gas that traps heat in the earth s atmosphere
oil spills
an oil spill is the release of a liquid petroleum hydrocarbon into the environment especially marine areas due to human activity and is a form of pollution the term is usually applied to marine oil spills where oil is released into the ocean or coastal waters but spills may also occur on land oil spills may be due to releases of crude oil from tankers pipelines railcars offshore platforms drilling rigs and wells as well as spills of refined petroleum products  such as gasoline diesel  and their by-products heavier fuels used by large ships such as bunker fuel or the spill of any oily refuse or waste oil
major oil spills include the kuwaiti oil fires kuwaiti oil lakes lakeview gusher gulf war oil spill and the deepwater horizon oil spill spilt oil penetrates into the structure of the plumage of birds and the fur of mammals reducing its insulating ability and making them more vulnerable to temperature fluctuations and much less buoyant in the water cleanup and recovery from an oil spill is difficult and depends upon many factors including the type of oil spilled the temperature of the water  affecting evaporation and biodegradation  and the types of shorelines and beaches involved spills may take weeks months or even years to clean up
volatile organic compounds
volatile organic compounds  vocs  are gases or vapours emitted by various solids and liquids many of which have short- and long-term adverse effects on human health and the environment vocs from petroleum are toxic and foul the air and some like benzene are extremely toxic carcinogenic and cause dna damage benzene often makes up about 1  of crude oil and gasoline benzene is present in automobile exhaust more important for vapors from spills of diesel and crude oil are aliphatic volatile compounds although  less toxic  than compounds like benzene their overwhelming abundance can still cause health concerns even when benzene levels in the air are relatively low the compounds are sometimes collectively measured as  total petroleum hydrocarbons  or  tph  petroleum hydrocarbons such as gasoline diesel or jet fuel intruding into indoor spaces from underground storage tanks or brownfields threaten safety  eg explosive potential  and causes adverse health effects from inhalation 
waste oil
waste oil is used oil containing not only breakdown products but also impurities from use some examples of waste oil are used oils such as hydraulic oil transmission oil brake fluids motor oil crankcase oil gear box oil and synthetic oil many of the same problems associated with natural petroleum exist with waste oil when waste oil from vehicles drips out engines over streets and roads the oil travels into the water table bringing with it such toxins as benzene this poisons both soil and drinking water runoff from storms carries waste oil into rivers and oceans poisoning them as well
