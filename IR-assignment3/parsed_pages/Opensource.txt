open source - wikipedia
the open-source model is a more decentralized model of production in contrast with more centralized models of development such as those typically used in commercial software companies scientists view the open-source model as a case of open collaboration a main principle of open-source software development is peer production with products such as source code  blueprints  and documentation available to the public at no cost the open-source movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code since its principles spread across different fields to become what is known as open collaboration this model is also used for the development of open-source appropriate technologies and open-source drug discovery


history
in production and development open source as a development model promotes universal access via an open-source or free license to a product s design or blueprint and universal redistribution of that design or blueprint including subsequent improvements to it by anyone before the phrase open source became widely adopted developers and producers used a variety of other terms open source gained hold with the rise of the internet and the attendant need for massive retooling of the computing source code opening the source code enabled a self-enhancing diversity of production models communication paths and interactive communities the open-source software movement arose to clarify the environment that the new copyright licensing domain and consumer issues created
generally open source refers to a computer program in which the source code is available to the general public for use and or modification from its original design open-source code is meant to be a collaborative effort where programmers improve upon the source code and share the changes within the community typically this is not the case and code is merely released to the public under some license others can then download modify and publish their version  fork  back to the community today you find more projects with forked versions than unified projects worked by large teams
many large formal institutions have sprung up to support the development of the open-source movement including the apache software foundation which supports projects such as the open-source framework behind big data apache hadoop and an open-source http server apache http
sharing of technological information before the internet
the sharing of technological information predates the internet and the personal computer considerably for instance in the early years of automobile development a group of capital monopolists owned the rights to a 2-cycle gasoline engine patent originally filed by george b selden by controlling this patent they were able to monopolize the industry and force car manufacturers to adhere to their demands or risk a lawsuit in 1911 independent automaker henry ford won a challenge to the selden patent the result was that the selden patent became virtually worthless and a new association  which would eventually become the motor vehicle manufacturers association  was formed the new association instituted a cross-licensing agreement among all us auto manufacturers  although each company would develop technology and file patents these patents were shared openly and without the exchange of money among all the manufacturers by the time the us entered world war ii 92 ford patents and 515 patents from other companies were being shared among these manufacturers without any exchange of money  or lawsuits 
sharing of information with computers
in an open call process analogous to later internet-era open standards processes arpanet researchers used an open  request for comments   rfc  process to encourage feedback in early telecommunication network protocols this collaborative process of the 1960s led to the birth of the early internet in 1969
early instances of the free sharing of source code include ibm s source releases of its operating systems and other programs in the 1950s and 1960s and the share user group that formed to facilitate the exchange of software
in a foreshadowing of the internet software with source code included became available on bbs networks in the 1980s this was sometimes a necessity  distributing software written in basic and other interpreted languages can only be distributed as source code as there is no separate portable executable binary to distribute
example of bbs systems and networks that gathered source code and set up boards specifically to discuss its modification includes wwiv developed initially in basic by wayne bell a culture of modifying his software and distributing the modifications grew up so extensively that when the software was ported to first pascal then c   its source code continued to be distributed to registered users who would share mods and compile their own versions of the software this may have contributed to its being a dominant system and network despite being outside the fidonet umbrella that was shared by so many other bbs makers
the sharing of source code on the internet began when the internet was relatively primitive with software distributed via uucp usenet irc and gopher bsd for example was first widely distributed by posts to composlinux on the usenet which is also where its development was discussed linux followed in this model
the emergence of the  open source  term
the term  open source  was first proposed by a group of people in the free software movement who were critical of the political agenda and moral philosophy implied in the term  free software  and sought to reframe the discourse to reflect a more commercially minded position in addition the ambiguity of the term  free software  was seen as discouraging business adoption the group included christine peterson todd anderson larry augustin jon hall sam ockman michael tiemann and eric s raymond peterson suggested  open source  at a meeting held at palo alto california in reaction to netscape s announcement in january 1998 of a source code release for navigator linus torvalds gave his support the following day and phil hughes backed the term in linux journal richard stallman the founder of the free software movement initially seemed to adopt the term but later changed his mind netscape released its source code under the netscape public license and later under the mozilla public license
raymond was especially active in the effort to popularize the new term he made the first public call to the free software community to adopt it in february 1998 shortly after he founded the open source initiative in collaboration with bruce perens
the term gained further visibility through an event organized in april 1998 by technology publisher tim o reilly originally titled the  freeware summit  and later known as the  open source summit  the event was attended by the leaders of many of the most important free and open-source projects including linus torvalds larry wall brian behlendorf eric allman guido van rossum michael tiemann paul vixie jamie zawinski and eric raymond at that meeting alternatives to the term  free software  were discussed tiemann argued for  sourceware  as a new term while raymond argued for  open source  the assembled developers took a vote and the winner was announced at a press conference the same evening
 open source  has never managed to supersede entirely the older term  free software  giving rise to the combined term free and open-source software  foss 
economics
most economists agree that open-source candidates have an information good  also termed  knowledge good   aspect in general this suggests that the original work involves a great deal of time money and effort however the cost of reproducing the work is very low so that additional users may be added at zero or near zero cost   this is referred to as the marginal cost of a product copyright creates a monopoly so the price charged to consumers can be significantly higher than the marginal cost of production this allows the author to recoup the cost of making the original work without needing to find a single customer that can bear the entire cost conventional copyright thus creates access costs for consumers who value the work more than the marginal cost but less than the initial production cost access costs also pose problems for authors who wish to create a derivative work such as a copy of a software program modified to fix a bug or add a feature or a remix of a song but are unable or unwilling to pay the copyright holder for the right to do so
being organized effectively as a consumers  cooperative the idea of open source is to eliminate the access costs of the consumer and the creators of derivative works by reducing the restrictions of copyright basic economic theory predicts that lower costs would lead to higher consumption and also more frequent creation of derivative works additionally some proponents argue that open source also relieves society of the administration and enforcement costs of copyright organizations such as creative commons have websites where individuals can file for alternative  licenses  or levels of restriction for their works these self-made protections free the general society of the costs of policing copyright infringement thus on several fronts there is an efficiency argument to be made on behalf of open-sourced goods
however others argue that because consumers do not pay for the copies creators are unable to recoup the initial cost of production and thus have no economic incentive to create in the first place by this argument consumers would lose out because some of the goods they would otherwise purchase would not be available at all in practice content producers can choose whether to adopt a proprietary license and charge for copies or an open license some goods which require large amounts of professional research and development such as the pharmaceutical industry  which depends largely on patents not copyright for intellectual property protection  are almost exclusively proprietary although increasingly sophisticated technologies are being developed on open-source principles
there is growing evidence however that open-source development creates enormous value for example in the context of open-source hardware design digital designs are shared for free and then anyone with access to digital manufacturing technologies  eg reprap 3d printers  can replicate the product for the cost of materials the original sharer gains feedback and potentially improvements on the original design from the peer production community
alternatives
alternative arrangements have also been shown to result in good creation outside of the proprietary model examples include 
applications
social and political views have been affected by the growth of the concept of open source advocates in one field often support the expansion of open source in other fields but eric raymond and other founders of the open-source movement have sometimes publicly argued against speculation about applications outside software saying that strong arguments for software openness should not be weakened by overreaching into areas where the story may be less compelling the broader impact of the open-source movement and the extent of its role in the development of new information sharing procedures remain to be seen
the open-source movement has inspired increased transparency and liberty in biotechnology research for example by cambia even the research methodologies themselves can benefit from the application of open-source principles it has also given rise to the rapidly expanding open-source hardware movement in the book democratizing innovation it is argued that a trend toward democratized innovation in physical products  eg open-source hardware  is occurring like the free and open-source software movement and that the difference between crowdsourcing and open source is that open-source production is a cooperative activity initiated and voluntarily undertaken by members of the public one of the primary geographically diverse communities that is utilizing this developmental method is the scientific community for example using open-source hardware to reduce the cost of scientific equipment
computer software
open-source software is software whose source code is published and made available to the public enabling anyone to copy modify and redistribute the source code without paying royalties or fees open-source code can evolve through community cooperation these communities are composed of individual programmers as well as large companies some of the individual programmers who start an open-source project may end up establishing companies offering products or services incorporating open-source programs examples of open-source software products are 
electronics
open-source hardware is hardware whose initial specification usually in a software format are published and made available to the public enabling anyone to copy modify and redistribute the hardware and source code without paying royalties or fees open-source hardware evolves through community cooperation these communities are composed of individual hardware software developers hobbyists as well as very large companies examples of open-source hardware initiatives are

society and culture
open-source culture is the creative practice of appropriation and free sharing of found and created content examples include collage found footage film music and appropriation art open-source culture is one in which fixations works entitled to copyright protection are made generally available participants in the culture can modify those products and redistribute them back into the community or other organizations
the rise of open-source culture in the 20th century resulted from a growing tension between creative practices that involve appropriation and therefore require access to content that is often copyrighted and increasingly restrictive intellectual property laws and policies governing access to copyrighted content the two main ways in which intellectual property laws became more restrictive in the 20th century were extensions to the term of copyright  particularly in the united states  and penalties such as those articulated in the digital millennium copyright act  dmca  placed on attempts to circumvent anti-piracy technologies
although artistic appropriation is often permitted under fair-use doctrines the complexity and ambiguity of these doctrines creates an atmosphere of uncertainty among cultural practitioners also the protective actions of copyright owners create what some call a  chilling effect  among cultural practitioners
in the late 20th century cultural practitioners began to adopt the intellectual property licensing techniques of free software and open-source software to make their work more freely available to others including the creative commons
the idea of an  open-source  culture runs parallel to  free culture  but is substantively different free culture is a term derived from the free software movement and in contrast to that vision of culture proponents of open-source culture  osc  maintain that some intellectual property law needs to exist to protect cultural producers yet they propose a more nuanced position than corporations have traditionally sought instead of seeing intellectual property law as an expression of instrumental rules intended to uphold either natural rights or desirable outcomes an argument for osc takes into account diverse goods  as in  the good life   and ends
one way of achieving the goal of making the fixations of cultural work generally available is to maximally utilize technology and digital media in keeping with moore s law s prediction about processors the cost of digital media and storage plummeted in the late 20th century consequently the marginal cost of digitally duplicating anything capable of being transmitted via digital media dropped to near zero combined with an explosive growth in personal computer and technology ownership the result is an increase in general population s access to digital media this phenomenon facilitated growth in open-source culture because it allowed for rapid and inexpensive duplication and distribution of culture where the access to the majority of culture produced prior to the advent of digital media was limited by other constraints of proprietary and potentially  open  mediums digital media is the latest technology with the potential to increase access to cultural products artists and users who choose to distribute their work digitally face none of the physical limitations that traditional cultural producers have been typically faced with accordingly the audience of an open-source culture faces little physical cost in acquiring digital media
open-source culture precedes richard stallman s codification of free software with the creation of the free software movement as the public began to communicate through bulletin board systems  bbs  like fidonet places like sourcery systems bbs were dedicated to providing source code to public domain shareware and freeware programs
essentially born out of a desire for increased general access to digital media the internet is open-source culture s most valuable asset it is questionable whether the goals of an open-source culture could be achieved without the internet the global network not only fosters an environment where culture can be generally accessible but also allows for easy and inexpensive redistribution of culture back into various communities some reasons for this are as follows
first the internet allows even greater access to inexpensive digital media and storage instead of users being limited to their own facilities and resources they are granted access to a vast network of facilities and resources some free sites such as ccmixter offer up free web space for anyone willing to license their work under a creative commons license the resulting cultural product is then available to download free  generally accessible  to anyone with an internet connection second users are granted unprecedented access to each other older analog technologies such as the telephone or television have limitations on the kind of interaction users can have in the case of television there is little if any interaction between users participating on the network and in the case of the telephone users rarely interact with any more than a couple of their known peers on the internet however users have the potential to access and meet millions of their peers this aspect of the internet facilitates the modification of culture as users are able to collaborate and communicate with each other across international and cultural boundaries the speed in which digital media travels on the internet in turn facilitates the redistribution of culture
through various technologies such as peer-to-peer networks and blogs cultural producers can take advantage of vast social networks to distribute their products as opposed to traditional media distribution redistributing digital media on the internet can be virtually costless technologies such as bittorrent and gnutella take advantage of various characteristics of the internet protocol  tcp ip  in an attempt to totally decentralize file distribution

ethics
open-source ethics is split into two strands 
religion
irish philosopher richard kearney has used the term  open-source hinduism  to refer to the way historical figures such as mohandas gandhi and swami vivekananda worked upon this ancient tradition
media
open-source journalism formerly referred to the standard journalistic techniques of news gathering and fact checking reflecting open-source intelligence a similar term used in military intelligence circles now open-source journalism commonly refers to forms of innovative publishing of online journalism rather than the sourcing of news stories by a professional journalist in the december 25 2006 issue of time magazine this is referred to as user created content and listed alongside more traditional open-source projects such as opensolaris and linux
weblogs or blogs are another significant platform for open-source culture blogs consist of periodic reverse chronologically ordered posts using a technology that makes webpages easily updatable with no understanding of design code or file transfer required while corporations political campaigns and other formal institutions have begun using these tools to distribute information many blogs are used by individuals for personal expression political organizing and socializing some such as livejournal or wordpress utilize open-source software that is open to the public and can be modified by users to fit their own tastes whether the code is open or not this format represents a nimble tool for people to borrow and re-present culture  whereas traditional websites made the illegal reproduction of culture difficult to regulate the mutability of blogs makes  open sourcing  even more uncontrollable since it allows a larger portion of the population to replicate material more quickly in the public sphere
messageboards are another platform for open-source culture messageboards  also known as discussion boards or forums  are places online where people with similar interests can congregate and post messages for the community to read and respond to messageboards sometimes have moderators who enforce community standards of etiquette such as banning users who are spammers other common board features are private messages  where users can send messages to one another  as well as chat  a way to have a real time conversation online  and image uploading some messageboards use phpbb which is a free open-source package where blogs are more about individual expression and tend to revolve around their authors messageboards are about creating a conversation amongst its users where information can be shared freely and quickly messageboards are a way to remove intermediaries from everyday life for instance instead of relying on commercials and other forms of advertising one can ask other users for frank reviews of a product movie or cd by removing the cultural middlemen messageboards help speed the flow of information and exchange of ideas
opendocument is an open document file format for saving and exchanging editable office documents such as text documents  including memos reports and books  spreadsheets charts and presentations organizations and individuals that store their data in an open format such as opendocument avoid being locked into a single software vendor leaving them free to switch software if their current vendor goes out of business raises their prices changes their software or changes their licensing terms to something less favorable
open-source movie production is either an open call system in which a changing crew and cast collaborate in movie production a system in which the end result is made available for re-use by others or in which exclusively open-source products are used in the production the 2006 movie elephants dream is said to be the  world s first open movie  created entirely using open-source technology
an open-source documentary film has a production process allowing the open contributions of archival material footage and other filmic elements both in unedited and edited form similar to crowdsourcing by doing so on-line contributors become part of the process of creating the film helping to influence the editorial and visual material to be used in the documentary as well as its thematic development the first open-source documentary film is the non-profit  the american revolution  which went into development in 2006 and will examine the role media played in the cultural social and political changes from 1968 to 1974 through the story of radio station wbcn-fm in boston the film is being produced by lichtenstein creative media and the non-profit filmmakers collaborative open source cinema is a website to create basement tapes a feature documentary about copyright in the digital age co-produced by the national film board of canada open-source film-making refers to a form of film-making that takes a method of idea formation from open-source software but in this case the  source  for a filmmaker is raw unedited footage rather than programming code it can also refer to a method of film-making where the process of creation is  open  ie a disparate group of contributors at different times contribute to the final piece
open-iptv is iptv that is not limited to one recording studio production studio or cast open-iptv uses the internet or other means to pool efforts and resources together to create an online community that all contributes to a show
education
within the academic community there is discussion about expanding what could be called the  intellectual commons   analogous to the creative commons  proponents of this view have hailed the connexions project at rice university opencourseware project at mit eugene thacker s article on  open-source dna  the  open source cultural database  salman khan s khan academy and wikipedia as examples of applying open source outside the realm of computer software
open-source curricula are instructional resources whose digital source can be freely used distributed and modified
another strand to the academic community is in the area of research many funded research projects produce software as part of their work there is an increasing interest in making the outputs of such projects available under an open-source license in the uk the joint information systems committee  jisc  has developed a policy on open-source software jisc also funds a development service called oss watch which acts as an advisory service for higher and further education institutions wishing to use contribute to and develop open-source software
on march 30 2010 president barack obama signed the health care and education reconciliation act which included  2 billion over four years to fund the taaccct program which is described as  the largest oer  open education resources  initiative in the world and uniquely focused on creating curricula in partnership with industry for credentials in vocational industry sectors like manufacturing health energy transportation and it 
innovation communities
the principle of sharing pre-dates the open-source movement  for example the free sharing of information has been institutionalized in the scientific enterprise since at least the 19th century open-source principles have always been part of the scientific community the sociologist robert k merton described the four basic elements of the community universalism  an international perspective  communalism  sharing information  disinterestedness  removing one s personal views from the scientific inquiry  and organized skepticism  requirements of proof and review  that accurately describe the scientific community today
these principles are in part complemented by us law s focus on protecting expression and method but not the ideas themselves there is also a tradition of publishing research results to the scientific community instead of keeping all such knowledge proprietary one of the recent initiatives in scientific publishing has been open access the idea that research should be published in such a way that it is free and available to the public there are currently many open access journals where the information is available free online however most journals do charge a fee  either to users or libraries for access  the budapest open access initiative is an international effort with the goal of making all research articles available free on the internet
the national institutes of health has recently proposed a policy on  enhanced public access to nih research information  this policy would provide a free searchable resource of nih-funded results to the public and with other international repositories six months after its initial publication the nih s move is an important one because there is significant amount of public funding in scientific research many of the questions have yet to be answered the balancing of profit vs public access and ensuring that desirable standards and incentives do not diminish with a shift to open access
farmavitanet is a community of pharmaceuticals executives that has recently proposed a new business model of open-source pharmaceuticals the project is targeted to development and sharing of know-how for manufacture of essential and life-saving medicines it is mainly dedicated to the countries with less developed economies where local pharmaceutical research and development resources are insufficient for national needs it will be limited to generic  off-patent  medicines with established use by the definition medicinal product have a  well-established use  if is used for at least 15 years with recognized efficacy and an acceptable level of safety in that event the expensive clinical test and trial results could be replaced by appropriate scientific literature
benjamin franklin was an early contributor eventually donating all his inventions including the franklin stove bifocals and the lightning rod to the public domain
new ngo communities are starting to use the open-source technology as a tool one example is the open source youth network started in 2007 in lisboa by isca members
open innovation is also a new emerging concept which advocate putting r d in a common pool the eclipse platform is openly presenting itself as an open innovation network
arts and recreation
copyright protection is used in the performing arts and even in athletic activities some groups have attempted to remove copyright from such practices
in 2012 russian music composer scientist and russian pirate party member victor argonov presented detailed raw files of his electronic opera  2032  under free license cc-by-nc 3.0 this opera was originally composed and published in 2007 by russian label mc entertainment as a commercial product but then the author changed its status to free in his blog  he said that he decided to open raw files  including wav midi and other used formats  to the public in order to support worldwide pirate actions against sopa and pipa several internet resources called  2032  the first open-source musical opera in history
other related movements
the following are events and applications that have been developed via the open source community as and echo the ideologies of the open source movement
open education consortium   an organization composed of various colleges that support open source and share some of their material online this organization headed by massachusetts institute of technology was established to aid in the exchange of open source educational materials
wikipedia   user-generated online encyclopedia with sister projects in academic areas such as wikiversity   a community dedicated to the creation and exchange of learning materials
project gutenberg   prior to the existence of google scholar beta this was the first supplier of electronic books and the very first free library project
synthetic biology- synthetic biology is considered the feasibility of the open source movement this new technology is important and exciting because it promises to enable cheap lifesaving new drugs as well as helping to yield biofuels that may help to solve our energy problem although synthetic biology has not yet come out of its  lab  stage it has great potential to become industrialized in the near future in order to industrialize open source science there are some scientists who are trying to build their own brand of it
ideologically related movements
the open access movement is a movement that is similar in ideology to the open source movement members of this movement maintain that academic material should be readily available to provide help with  future research assist in teaching and aid in academic purposes  the open access movement aims to eliminate subscription fees and licensing restrictions of academic materials
the free culture movement is a movement that seeks to achieve a culture that engages in collective freedom via freedom of expression free public access to knowledge and information full demonstration of creativity and innovation in various arenas and promotion of citizen liberties
creative commons is an organization that  develops supports and stewards legal and technical infrastructure that maximizes digital creativity sharing and innovation  it encourages the use of protected properties online for research education and creative purposes in pursuit of a universal access creative commons provides an infrastructure through a set of copyright licenses and tools that creates a better balance within the realm of  all rights reserved  properties the creative commons license offers a slightly more lenient alternative to  all rights reserved  copyrights for those who do not wish to exclude the use of their material
the zeitgeist movement is an international social movement that advocates a transition into a sustainable  resource-based economy  based on collaboration in which monetary incentives are replaced by commons-based ones with everyone having access to everything  from code to products  as in  open source everything  while its activism and events are typically focused on media and education tzm is a major supporter of open source projects worldwide since they allow for uninhibited advancement of science and technology independent of constraints posed by institutions of patenting and capitalist investment
p2p foundation is an  international organization focused on studying researching documenting and promoting peer to peer practices in a very broad sense  its objectives incorporate those of the open source movement whose principles are integrated in a larger socio-economic model
