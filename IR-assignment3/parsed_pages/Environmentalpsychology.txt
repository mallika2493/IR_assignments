environmental psychology - wikipedia
environmental psychology is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the interplay between individuals and their surroundings the field defines the term environment broadly encompassing natural environments social settings built environments learning environments and informational environments
since its conception the field has been committed to the development of a discipline that is both value oriented and problem oriented prioritizing research aimed at solving complex environmental problems in the pursuit of individual well-being within a larger society when solving problems involving human-environment interactions whether global or local one must have a model of human nature that predicts the environmental conditions under which humans will behave this model can help design manage protect and or restore environments that enhance reasonable behavior predict the likely outcomes when these conditions are not met and diagnose problem situations the field develops such a model of human nature while retaining a broad and inherently multidisciplinary focus it explores such dissimilar issues as common property resource management wayfinding in complex settings the effect of environmental stress on human performance the characteristics of restorative environments human information processing and the promotion of durable conservation behavior
this multidisciplinary paradigm has not only characterized the dynamic for which environmental psychology is expected to develop it has also been the catalyst in attracting other schools of knowledge in its pursuit aside from research psychologists geographers economists landscape architects policy-makers sociologists anthropologists educators and product developers all have discovered and participated in this field
although  environmental psychology  is arguably the best-known and most comprehensive description of the field it is also known as human factors science cognitive ergonomics ecological psychology ecopsychology environment behavior studies and person environment studies closely related fields include architectural psychology socio-architecture behavioral geography environmental sociology social ecology and environmental design research


history
the origins of this field of study are unknown however willy hellpach is said to be the first to mention  environmental psychology  one of his books geopsyche discusses topics such as how the sun and the moon affect human activity the impact of extreme environments and the effects of color and form among the other major scholars at the roots of environmental psychology were jakob von uexk ll kurt lewin egon brunswik and later gerhard kaminski and carl friedrich graumann
the end of world war ii brought about a higher demand for developments in the field of social psychology particularly in the areas of attitude change small group processes and intergroup conflict this demand caused psychologists to begin applying social psychology theories to a number of social issues such as prejudice war and peace it was thought that if these problems were addressed underlying notions and principles would surface
although this period was crucial to the development of the field the methodologies used to carry out the studies were questionable at the time studies were being conducted in a laboratory setting which caused some doubt as to their validity in the real world consequently environmental psychologists began to conduct studies outside of the laboratory enabling the field to continue to progress today environmental psychology is being applied to many different areas such as architecture and design television programs and advertisements 
orientations

problem oriented
environmental psychology is a direct study of the relationship between an environment and how that environment affects its inhabitants specific aspects of this field work by identifying a problem and through the identification of said problem discovering a solution therefore it is necessary for environmental psychology to be problem oriented
one important aspect of a problem-oriented field is that by identifying problems solutions arise from the research acquired the solutions can aid in making society function better as a whole and create a wealth of knowledge about the inner workings of societies environmental psychologist harold proshansky discusses how the field is also  value oriented  because of the field s commitment to bettering society through problem identification proshansky discusses the importance of not only understanding the problem but also the necessity of a solution proshansky also points out some of the problems of a problem-oriented approach for environmental psychology first the problems being identified must be studied under certain specifications  it must be ongoing and occurring in real life not in a laboratory second the notions about the problems must derive directly from the source - meaning they must come directly from the specific environment where the problem is occurring the solutions and understanding of the problems cannot come from an environment that has been constructed and modeled to look like real life environmental psychology needs to reflect the actual society not a society built in a laboratory setting the difficult task of the environmental psychologist is to study problems as they are occurring in everyday life it is hard to reject all laboratory research because laboratory experiments are where theories may be tested without damaging the actual environment or can serve as models when testing solutions proshansky makes this point as well discussing the difficulty in the overall problem oriented approach he states that it is important however for the environmental psychologist to utilize all aspects of research and analysis of the findings and to take into account both the general and individualized aspects of the problems
environmental psychology addresses environmental problems such as density and crowding noise pollution sub-standard living and urban decay noise increases environmental stress although it has been found that control and predictability are the greatest factors in stressful effects of noise  context pitch source and habituation are also important variables  environmental psychologists have theorized that density and crowding can also have an adverse effect on mood and may cause stress-related illness to understand and solve environmental problems environmental psychologists believe concepts and principles should come directly from the physical settings and problems being looked at for example factors that reduce feelings of crowding within buildings include 
having an area of personal territory in a public space eg at the office is a key feature of many architectural designs having such a  defensible space  can reduce the negative effects of crowding in urban environments the term coined by john b calhoun in 1947 is the result of multiple environmental experiments conducted on rats originally beginning as an experiment to measure how many rats could be accommodated in a given space it expanded into determining how rats given the proper food shelter and bedding would behave under a confined environment
under these circumstances the males became aggressive some exclusively homosexual others became pansexual and hypersexual seeking every chance to mount any rat they encountered as a result mating behaviors were upset with an increase in infant mortalities with parents failing to provide proper nests thoughtlessly ditching their young and even attacking them infant mortality rose as high as 96  in certain sections calhoun published the results as  population density and social pathology  in a 1962 edition of scientific american
creating barriers and customizing the space are ways of creating personal space eg using pictures of one s family in an office setting this increases cognitive control as one sees oneself as having control over the competitors to the personal space and therefore able to control the level of density and crowding in the space
systems oriented
the systems oriented approach to experimenting is applied to individuals or people that are a part of communities groups and organizations this approach particularly examines group interaction as opposed to an individual s interaction and it emphasizes on factors of social integration in the laboratory experiments focus on cause and effect processes within human nature
interdisciplinary oriented
environmental psychology relies on interaction with other disciplines in order to approach problems with multiple perspectives the first discipline is the category of behavioral sciences which include  sociology political science anthropology and economics environmental psychology also interacts with the interspecializations of the field of psychology which include  developmental psychology cognitive science organization theory psychobiology psychoanalysis and social neuroscience in addition to the more scientific fields of study environmental psychology also works with the design field which includes  the studies of architecture interior design urban planning industrial and object design landscape architecture and preservation
space-over-time orientation
space over time orientation highlights the importance of the past examining problems with the past in mind creates a better understanding of how past forces such as social political and economic forces may be of relevance to present and future problems time and place are also important to consider it s important to look at time over extended periods physical settings change over time  they change with respect to physical properties and they change because individuals using the space change over time looking at these spaces over time will help monitor the changes and possibly predict future problems
there are a variety of tests that can be administered to children in order to determine their temperament temperament is split up into three types   easy   difficult  and  slow-to-warm-up  alexander thomas stella chess herbert g birch margaret hertzig and sam korn created an infant temperament test in the 1950s and rated them using nine temperament criteria by finding out a child s temperament at birth it enables us to know what to expect as the child progresses into adulthood
concepts
place identity
for many years harold proshansky and his colleagues at the graduate school and university center of the city university of new york explored the concept of place identity place identity has been traditionally defined as a  sub-structure of the self-identity of the person consisting of broadly conceived cognitions about the physical world in which the individual lives  these cognitions define the daily experiences of every human being through one s attitudes feelings ideas memories personal values and preferences toward the range and type of physical settings he she can then understand the environment they live in and their overall experience
as a person interacts with various places and spaces he she is able to evaluate which properties in different environments fulfill his her various needs when a place contains components that satisfy a person biologically socially psychologically and or culturally it creates the environmental past of a person through  good  or  bad  experiences with a place a person is then able to reflect and define their personal values attitudes feelings and beliefs about the physical world
place identity has been described as the individual s incorporation of place into the larger concept of self  a  potpourri of memories conceptions interpretations ideas and related feelings about specific physical settings as well as types of settings  other theorists have been instrumental in the creation of the idea of place identity three humanistic geographers tuan  1980  relph  1976  and buttimer  1980  share a couple of basic assumptions as a person lives and creates memories within a place attachment is built and it is through one s personal connection to a place that he she gains a sense of belonging and purpose which then gives significance and meaning to their life
five central functions of place-identity have been depicted  recognition meaning expressive-requirement mediating change and anxiety and defense function place identity becomes a cognitive  database  against which every physical setting is experienced the activities of a person often overlap with physical settings which then create a background for the rest of life s interactions and events the individual is frequently unaware of the array of feelings values or memories of a singular place and simply becomes more comfortable or uncomfortable with certain broad kinds of physical settings or prefers specific spaces to others in the time since the term  place identity  was introduced the theory has been the model for identity that has dominated environmental psychology
place attachment
many different perceptions of the bond between people and places have been hypothesized and studied the most widespread terms include place attachment and sense of place one consistent thread woven throughout most recent research on place attachment deals with the importance of the amount of time spent at a certain place  the length of association with a place  while both researchers and writers have made the case that time and experience in a place are important for deepening the meanings and emotional ties central to the person-place relationship little in-depth research has studied these factors and their role in forging this connection
place attachment is de ned as one s emotional or affective ties to a place and is generally thought to be the result of a long-term connection with a certain environment this is different from a simple aesthetic response such as saying a certain place is special because it is beautiful for example one can have an emotional response to a beautiful  or ugly  landscape or place but this response may sometimes be shallow and  eeting this distinction is one that schroeder labeled  meaning versus preference  according to schroeder the definition of  meaning  is  the thoughts feelings memories and interpretations evoked by a landscape   whereas  preference  is  the degree of liking for one landscape compared to another  for a deeper and lasting emotional attachment to develop  or in schroeder s terms for it to have meaning  an enduring relationship with a place is usually a critical factor chigbu carried out a rural study of place-attachment using a qualitative approach to check its impact on a community uturu  in nigeria  and found that it has direct relationship to level of community development
environmental consciousness
leanne rivlin theorized that one way to examine an individual s environmental consciousness is to recognize how the physical place is significant and look at the people place relationship
environmental cognition  involved in human cognition  plays a crucial role in environmental perception all different areas of the brain engage with environmentally relevant information some believe that the orbitofrontal cortex integrates environmentally relevant information from many distributed areas of the brain due to its anterior location within the frontal cortex the orbitofrontal cortex may make judgments about the environment and refine the organism s  understanding  through error analysis and other processes specific to prefrontal cortex but to be certain there is no single brain area dedicated to the organism s interactions with its environment rather all brain areas are dedicated to this task one area  probably the orbitofrontal cortex  may collate the various pieces of the informational puzzle in order to develop a long term strategy of engagement with the ever changing  environment  moreover the orbitofrontal cortex may show the greatest change in blood oxygenation  bold level  when an organism thinks of the broad and amorphous category referred to as  the environment  because of the recent concern with the environment environmental consciousness or awareness has come to be related to the growth and development of understanding and consciousness toward the biophysical environment and its problems
behavior settings
the earliest noteworthy discoveries in the field of environmental psychology can be dated back to roger barker who created the field of ecological psychology founding his research station in oskaloosa kansas in 1947 his field observations expanded into the theory that social settings influence behavior empirical data gathered in oskaloosa from 1947 to 1972 helped him develop the concept of the  behavior setting  to help explain the relationship between the individual and the immediate environment this was further explored in his work with paul gump in the book big school small school  high school size and student behavior one of the first insightful explanations on why groups tend to be less satisfying for their members as they increase in size their studies illustrated that large schools had a similar number of behavior settings to that of small schools this resulted in the students  ability to presume many different roles in small schools  eg be in the school band and the school football team  but in larger schools there was a propensity to deliberate over their social choices
in his book ecological psychology  1968  barker stresses the importance of the town s behavior and environment as the residents  most ordinary instrument of describing their environment  the hybrid eco-behavioral character of behavior settings appear to present midwest s inhabitants with no difficulty  nouns that combine milieu and standing behavior are common eg oyster supper basketball game turkey dinner golden gavel ceremony cake walk back surgery gift exchange livestock auction auto repair 
barker argued that his students should implement t-methods  psychologist as  transducer   ie methods in which they studied man in his  natural environment   rather than o-methods  psychologist as  operators  ie experimental methods  basically barker preferred fieldwork and direct observation rather than controlled experiments some of the minute-by-minute observations of kansan children from morning to night jotted down by young and maternal graduate students may be the most intimate and poignant documents in social science barker spent his career expanding on what he called ecological psychology identifying these behavior settings and publishing accounts such as one boy s day  1952  and midwest and its children  1955 
applications
impact on the built environment
environmental psychologists rejected the laboratory-experimental paradigm because of its simplification and skewed view of the cause-and-effect relationships of human s behaviors and experiences environmental psychologists examine how one or more parameters produce an effect while other measures are controlled it is impossible to manipulate real-world settings in a laboratory
environmental psychology is oriented towards influencing the work of design professionals  architects engineers interior designers urban planners etc  and thereby improving the human environment
on a civic scale efforts towards improving pedestrian landscapes have paid off to some extent from the involvement of figures like jane jacobs and copenhagen s jan gehl one prime figure here is the late writer and researcher william h whyte his still-refreshing and perceptive  city  based on his accumulated observations of skilled manhattan pedestrians provides steps and patterns of use in urban plazas
the role and impact of architecture on human behavior is debated within the architectural profession views range from  supposing that people will adapt to new architectures and city forms  believing that architects cannot predict the impact of buildings on humans and therefore should base decisions on other factors  to those who undertake detailed precedent studies of local building types and how they are used by that society
environmental psychology has conquered the whole architectural genre which is concerned with retail stores and any other commercial venues that have the power to manipulate the mood and behavior of customers  eg stadiums casinos malls and now airports  from philip kotler s landmark paper on atmospherics and alan hirsch s  effects of ambient odors on slot-machine usage in a las vegas casino  through the creation and management of the gruen transfer retail relies heavily on psychology original research focus groups and direct observation one of william whyte s students paco underhill makes a living as a  shopping anthropologist  most of this advanced research remains a trade secret and proprietary

challenges
the field saw significant research findings and a fair surge of interest in the late 1970s and early 1980s but has seen challenges of nomenclature obtaining objective and repeatable results scope and the fact that some research rests on underlying assumptions about human perception which is not fully understood being an interdisciplinary field is difficult because it lacks a solid definition and purpose it is hard for the field to fit into organizational structures in the words of guido francescato speaking in 2000 environmental psychology encompasses a  somewhat bewildering array of disparate methodologies conceptual orientations and interpretations making it difficult to delineate with any degree of precision just what the field is all about and what might it contribute to the construction of society and the unfolding of history 
environmental psychology has not received nearly enough supporters to be considered an interdisciplinary field within psychology harold m proshanksy was one of the founders of environmental psychology and was quoted as saying  as i look at the field of environmental psychology today i am concerned about its future it has not since its emergence in the early 1960s grown to the point where it can match the fields of social personality learning or cognitive psychology to be sure it has increased in membership in the number of journals devoted to it and even in the amount of professional organizational support it enjoys but not enough so that one could look at any major university and find it to be a field of specialization in a department of psychology or more importantly in an interdisciplinary center or institute
