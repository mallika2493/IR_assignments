environmental planning - wikipedia
environmental planning is the process of facilitating decision making to carry out land development with the consideration given to the natural environment social political economic and governance factors and provides a holistic framework to achieve sustainable outcomes a major goal of environmental planning is to create sustainable communities which aim to conserve and protect undeveloped land


elements
environmental planning concerns itself with the decision making processes where they are required for managing relationships that exist within and between natural systems and human systems environmental planning endeavors to manage these processes in an effective orderly transparent and equitable manner for the benefit of all constituents within such systems for the present and for the future present day environmental planning practices are the result of continuous refinement and expansion of the scope of such decision making processes some of the main elements of present-day environmental planning are 
the environmental planning assessments encompass areas such as land use socio-economics transportation economic and housing characteristics air pollution noise pollution the wetlands habitat of the endangered species flood zones susceptibility coastal zones erosion and visual studies among others and is referred to as an integrated environmental planning assessment it is the ability to analyze environmental issues that will facilitate critical decision making

united states
in the united states for any project environmental planners deal with a full range of environmental regulations from federal to state and city levels administered federally by the environmental protection agency a rigorous environmental process has to be undertaken to examine the impacts and possible mitigation of any construction project depending on the scale and impact of the project an extensive environmental review is known as an environmental impact statement  eis  and the less extensive version is environmental assessment  ea  procedures follow guidelines from national environmental policy act  nepa  state environmental quality review act  seqra  and or city environmental quality review  ceqr  and other related federal or state agencies published regulations
the association of environmental professionals  aep  is a non-profit organization of interdisciplinary professionals including environmental science resource management environmental planning and other professions contributing to this field aep is the first organization of its kind in the usa and its influence and model have spawned numerous other regional organizations throughout the united states its mission is to improve the technical skills of members and the organization is dedicated to  the enhancement maintenance and protection of the natural and human environment  from inception in the mid-1970s the organization has been closely linked with the maintenance of the california environmental quality act  ceqa  due to california being one of the first states to adopt a comprehensive legal framework to govern the environmental review of public policy and project review
asia
in the philippines the republic act 10587 governs the practice of environmental planning the law defines environmental planning as  a multi-disciplinary art and science of analyzing specifying clarifying harmonizing managing and regulating the use and development of land and water resources in relation to their environs for the development of sustainable communities and ecosystems  it is sometimes referred to as urban and regional planning city planning town and country planning and or human settlements planning
an environmental planner is a person who is registered and licensed to practice environmental planning and who holds a valid certificate of registration and a valid professional identification card from the board of environmental planning and the professional regulation commission of the republic of the philippines to be a licensed planner one must prove that he she has at least 2 years planning experience or a master s degree in a relevant field of study aside from a bachelor s degree in engineering architecture economics and other related social sciences areas of competency for planners are 
there is a current move to require in five years time the bachelor of science in environmental planning as a requisite for one to be a licensed environmental planner as of this writing the curriculum for bs environmental planning is being reviewed by the board of environmental planning and the commission on higher education  ched 
the only accredited organization for environmental planners in the philippines is the philippine institute of environmental planners  piep

australia
background
table 1.0 depicts the changes of focus in planning over the last 300 years in australia which has evolved from an amenity and resource use focus to an integrated approach which espouses the stewardship of natural systems for the continued long term viability of both human and natural systems
regulatory framework
relevant environment protection planning   administering agencies and legislation at the level of commonwealth states   territories are as shown in table below environmental planning policies vary from state to state
background
the incorporation of environmental considerations in land-use planning in australia began after the united nations conference on the human environment in stockholm sweden in 1972 one of the key principles developed in reference to planning and human activity was 
principle 13 in order to achieve a more rational management of resources and thus to improve the environment states should adopt an integrated and coordinated approach to their development planning so as to ensure that development is compatible with the need to protect and improve environment for the benefit of their populationunep
previous to this conference the united states congress passed national environmental policy act which created a process whereby government agencies were required to publicly state and justify the environmental impacts of their development proposals by preparing an environmental impact statement  eis  the eis structure was further developed by burchell and listokin  1975  and this approach has informed the development of environmental impact regulation worldwide  beer 1977  and resulted in the development of legislation within several australian states
recent environmental planning processes
in nsw the first attempt to incorporate environmental assessment and protection into planning law began in 1974 with the appointment of a planning and environment commission to overhaul the existing predominately urban land-use system after various delays the environmental planning and assessment act 1979  ep a act  came into force on 1 september 1980 the ep a act incorporated a three tired system of state regional and local levels of significance and required the relevant control authority to take into consideration the impacts to the environment  both natural and built  and the community of proposed development or land-use change within the ep a act most development requires a statement of environmental effects  see  or review of environmental effects  ref  detailing the impacts to both natural and human environments which should be taken into consideration by the regulatory authority significant projects require a more thorough environmental impact assessment with a corresponding greater public scrutiny
concurrent with this development was the establishment of a parallel legal system the land and environment court to arbitrate disputes the ep a act has been amended over time generally giving the government acting through the minister greater powers to determine approval of development particularly large projects of  state significance  but also to incorporate specific environmental laws such as the threatened species conservation act 1995  park 2010 
the environment effects act 1978 was the first environmental planning control in victoria and it assessed the environmental impact of significant developments via an environmental effects statement  ees  however the obligation for presenting an ees remained somewhat unclear and is ultimately at the discretion of the minister for planning  eccles and bryant 2007  the planning and environment act 1987 created a statewide nested planning process victoria planning provisions  vpp  which has within the statewide objectives 
 the protection of natural and man-made resources and the maintenance of ecological processes and genetic diversity   pae act 1987 s4 1  
to achieve these ends the vpp includes several overarching policy frameworks including the identification of important environmental values and assets such as  protection of catchments waterways and groundwater   coastal areas  and  conservation of native flora and fauna  below this level local planning schemes identify land-uses through zone designation and also identify land affected by other criteria called  overlays  overlays include environmental parameters such as  environmental significance   vegetation protection   erosion management  and  wildfire management  but also social issues like  neighbourhood character  below this again are various regulations on particular issues such as details pertaining to regulation of areas of native vegetation dse victoria
reform has occurred to the victorian framework in recent years aimed at improving land use and transport outcomes including consideration of environmental impacts the transport integration act identifies key planning agencies as interface bodies required to have regard to a vision for the transport system and objectives and decision making principles if decisions are likely to have a significant impact on victoria s transport system in addition the major transport projects facilitation act 2009 establishes a scheme to improve the approval and delivery of major rail road and ports projects
planning in south australia is coordinated within the development act 1993 under this law most urban and land-use planning is assessed against local plans of allowed development the minister must declare a proposed development either  major development  or a  major project  for it to be subjected to greater depth of environmental assessment and public consultation via an independent development assessment commission of experts complex proposals will generally require an indepth eis planning sa
the integrated planning act 1997 vested most planning control with local government but required  significant projects  to be assessed by a state coordinator general and usually required an environmental impact statement  eis 
this has been replaced by the sustainable planning act 2009 which came into force 18 december 2009 this law aims to  improve sustainable environmental outcomes through streamlined processes  and incorporates statewide regional and local planning hierarchies which follow the model of victoria s vpp the coordinator general may still declare projects to be  significant projects  which then require assessment under the state development and public works organisation act 1971  qld 
key milestones and decisions
europe
over the past decade the european union has given the environmental more attention with more strict legislation on such issues as air soil and water pollution as well regulations for toxic and hazardous substances currently over 18  of the territory belonging to the eu is denoted as protected areas for nature to date the european union s environmental policy is determined by the 7th environmental action programme and is expected to be followed up through 2020 the eu has goals beyond this however and hopes by 2050 to have an  innovative circular economy where nothing is wasted and where natural resources are managed sustainably and biodiversity is protected valued and restored in ways that enhance our society s resilience 
the eu has three core objectives to help achieve this vision  conservation of natural resources conversion to an efficient environmentally sustainable economy and protection of the health of citizens
