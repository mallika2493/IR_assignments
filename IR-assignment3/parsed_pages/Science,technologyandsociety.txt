science, technology and society - wikipedia
in science studies science technology and society  sts or science and technology studies  is the study of how social political and cultural values affect scientific research and technological innovation and how these in turn affect society politics and culture


history
like most interdisciplinary programs sts emerged from the confluence of a variety of disciplines and disciplinary subfields all of which had developed an interest typically during the 1960s or 1970s in viewing science and technology as socially embedded enterprises the key disciplinary components of sts took shape independently beginning in the 1960s and developed in isolation from each other well into the 1980s although ludwik fleck s monograph  1935  genesis and development of a scientific fact anticipated many of sts s key themes in the 1970s elting e morison founded the sts program at massachusetts institute of technology  mit  which served as a model by 2011 111 sts programs were counted
key themes
during the 1970s and 1980s leading universities in the us uk and europe began drawing these various components together in new interdisciplinary programs for example in the 1970s cornell university developed a new program that united science studies and policy-oriented scholars with historians and philosophers of science and technology each of these programs developed unique identities due to variation in the components that were drawn together as well as their location within the various universities for example the university of virginia s sts program united scholars drawn from a variety of fields  with particular strength in the history of technology   however the program s teaching responsibilities it is located within an engineering school and teaches ethics to undergraduate engineering students means that all of its faculty share a strong interest in engineering ethics
the  turn to technology   and beyond 
a decisive moment in the development of sts was the mid-1980s addition of technology studies to the range of interests reflected in science  during that decade two works appeared en seriatim that signaled what steve woolgar was to call the  turn to technology   social shaping of technology  mackenzie and wajcman 1985  and the social construction of technological systems  bijker hughes and pinch 1987  mackenzie and wajcman primed the pump by publishing a collection of articles attesting to the influence of society on technological design in a seminal article trevor pinch and wiebe bijker attached all the legitimacy of the sociology of scientific knowledge to this development by showing how the sociology of technology could proceed along precisely the theoretical and methodological lines established by the sociology of scientific knowledge this was the intellectual foundation of the field they called the social construction of technology
the  turn to technology  helped to cement an already growing awareness of underlying unity among the various emerging sts programs more recently there has been an associated turn to ecology nature and materiality in general whereby the socio-technical and natural material co-produce each other this is especially evident in work in sts analyses of biomedicine  such as carl may annemarie mol nelly oudshoorn and andrew webster  and ecological interventions  such as bruno latour sheila jasanoff matthias gross s lochlann jain and jens lachmund 
professional associations
the subject has several professional associations
founded in 1975 the society for social studies of science initially provided scholarly communication facilities including a journal  science technology and human values  and annual meetings that were mainly attended by science studies scholars the society has since grown into the most important professional association of science and technology studies scholars worldwide the society for social studies of science members also include government and industry officials concerned with research and development as well as science and technology policy  scientists and engineers who wish to better understand the social embeddedness of their professional practice  and citizens concerned about the impact of science and technology in their lives proposals have been made to add the word  technology  to the association s name thereby reflecting its stature as the leading sts professional society but there seems to be widespread sentiment that the name is long enough as it is
in europe the european association for the study of science and technology  easst  was founded in 1981 to  stimulate communication exchange and collaboration in the field of studies of science and technology  similarly the european inter-university association on society science and technology  esst  researches and studies science and technology in society in both historical and contemporary perspectives
in asia several sts associations exist in japan the japanese society for science and technology studies  jssts  was founded in 2001 the asia pacific science technology   society network  apstsn  primarily has members from australasia southeast and east asia and oceania
founded in 1958 the society for the history of technology initially attracted members from the history profession who had interests in the contextual history of technology after the  turn to technology  in the mid-1980s the society s well-regarded journal  technology and culture  and its annual meetings began to attract considerable interest from non-historians with technology studies interests
less identified with sts but also of importance to many sts scholars in the us are the history of science society the philosophy of science association and the american association for the history of medicine in addition there are significant sts-oriented special interest groups within major disciplinary associations including the american anthropological association the american political science association and the american sociological association

important concepts
deliberative democracy
deliberative democracy is a reform of representative or direct democracies which mandates discussion and debate of popular topics which affect society deliberative democracy is a tool for making decisions deliberative democracy can be traced back all the way to aristotle s writings more recently the term was coined by joseph bessette in his 1980 work  deliberative democracy  the majority principle in republican government  where he uses the idea in opposition to the elitist interpretations of the united states constitution with emphasis on public discussion
deliberative democracy can lead to more legitimate credible and trustworthy outcomes deliberative democracy allows for  a wider range of public knowledge  and it has been argued that this can lead to  more socially intelligent and robust  science one major shortcoming of deliberative democracy is that many models insufficiently ensure critical interaction
according to ryfe there are five mechanisms that stand out as critical to the successful design of deliberative democracy 
recently there has been a movement towards greater transparency in the fields of policy and technology jasanoff comes to the conclusion that there is no longer a question of if there needs to be increased public participation in making decisions about science and technology but now there needs to be ways to make a more meaningful conversation between the public and those developing the technology
ackerman and fishkin offer an example of a reform in their paper  deliberation day  the deliberation is to enhance public understanding of popular complex and controversial issues through devices such as fishkin s deliberative polling although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the united states federal government however things similar to this have been implemented in small local governments like new england towns and villages new england town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting
an ideal deliberative democracy balances the voice and influence of all participants while the main aim is to reach consensus a deliberative democracy should encourage the voices of those with opposing viewpoints concerns due to uncertainties and questions about assumptions made by other participants it should take its time and ensure that those participating understand the topics on which they debate independent managers of debates should also have substantial grasp of the concepts discussed but must   independent and impartial as to the outcomes of the process 
tragedy of the commons
in 1968 garrett hardin coined the phrase  tragedy of the commons  it is an economic theory where rational people act against the best interest of the group by consuming a common resource since then the tragedy of the commons has been used to symbolize the degradation of the environment whenever many individuals use a common resource although garrett hardin was not an sts scholar the concept of tragedy of the commons still applies to science technology and society
in a contemporary setting the internet acts as an example of the tragedy of the commons through the exploitation of digital resources and private information data and internet passwords can be stolen much more easily than physical documents virtual spying is almost free compared to the costs of physical spying additionally net neutrality can be seen as an example of tragedy of the commons in an sts context the movement for net neutrality argues that the internet should not be a resource that is dominated by one particular group specifically those with more money to spend on internet access
a counterexample to the tragedy of the commons is offered by andrew kahrl privatization is normally a healthy way to deal with the tragedy of the commons kahrl suggests that the privatization of beaches on long island in an attempt to combat overuse of long island beaches made the residents of long island more susceptible to flood damage from hurricane sandy the privatization of these beaches took away from the protection offered by the natural landscape tidal lands that offer natural protection were drained and developed this attempt to combat the tragedy of the commons by privatization was counter-productive privatization actually destroyed the public good of natural protection from the landscape
alternative modernity
alternative modernity is a conceptual tool conventionally used to represent the state of present western society modernity represents the political and social structures of the society the sum of interpersonal discourse and ultimately a snapshot of society s direction at a point in time unfortunately conventional modernity is incapable of modeling alternative directions for further growth within our society also this concept is ineffective at analyzing similar but unique modern societies such as those found in the diverse cultures of the developing world problems can be summarized into two elements  inward failure to analyze growth potentials of a given society and outward failure to model different cultures and social structures and predict their growth potentials
previously modernity carried a connotation of the current state of being modern and its evolution through european colonialism the process of becoming  modern  is believed to occur in a linear pre-determined way and is seen by philip brey as a way of to interpret and evaluate social and cultural formations this thought ties in with modernization theory the thought that societies progress from  pre-modern  to  modern  societies
within the field of science and technology there are two main lenses with which to view modernity the first is as a way for society to quantify what it wants to move towards in effect we can discuss the notion of  alternative modernity   as described by andrew feenberg  and which of these we would like to move towards alternatively modernity can be used to analyze the differences in interactions between cultures and individuals from this perspective alternative modernities exist simultaneously based on differing cultural and societal expectations of how a society  or an individual within society  should function because of different types of interactions across different cultures each culture will have a different modernity
pace of innovation
pace of innovation is the speed at which technological innovation or advancement is occurring with the most apparent instances being too slow or too rapid both these rates of innovation are extreme and therefore have effects on the people that get to use this technology
no innovation without representation
 no innovation without representation  is a democratic ideal of ensuring that everyone involved gets a chance to be represented fairly in technological developments
privileged positions of business and science
the privileged positions of business and science refer to the unique authority that persons in these areas hold in economic political and technosocial affairs businesses have strong decision-making abilities in the function of society essentially choosing what technological innovations to develop scientists and technologists have valuable knowledge ability to pursue the technological innovations they want they proceed largely without public scrutiny and as if they had the consent of those potentially affected by their discoveries and creations
legacy thinking
legacy thinking is defined as an inherited method of thinking imposed from an external source without objection by the individual due to the fact that it is already widely accepted by society
legacy thinking can impair the ability to drive technology for the betterment of society by blinding people to innovations that do not fit into their accepted model of how society works by accepting ideas without questioning them people often see all solutions that contradict these accepted ideas as impossible or impractical legacy thinking tends to advantage the wealthy who have the means to project their ideas on the public it may be used by the wealthy as a vehicle to drive technology in their favor rather than for the greater good examining the role of citizen participation and representation in politics provides an excellent example of legacy thinking in society the belief that one can spend money freely to gain influence has been popularized leading to public acceptance of corporate lobbying as a result a self-established role in politics has been cemented where the public does not exercise the power ensured to them by the constitution to the fullest extent this can become a barrier to political progress as corporations who have the capital to spend have the potential to wield great influence over policy legacy thinking however keeps the population from acting to change this despite polls from harris interactive that report over 80  of americans feel that big business holds too much power in government therefore americans are beginning to try to steer away this line of thought rejecting legacy thinking and demanding less corporate and more public participation in political decision making
additionally an examination of net neutrality functions as a separate example of legacy thinking starting with dial-up the internet has always been viewed as a private luxury good internet today is a vital part of modern-day society members they use it in and out of life every day corporations are able to mislabel and greatly overcharge for their internet resources since the american public is so dependent upon internet there is little for them to do legacy thinking has kept this pattern on track despite growing movements arguing that the internet should be considered a utility legacy thinking prevents progress because it was widely accepted by others before us through advertising that the internet is a luxury and not a utility due to pressure from grassroots movements the federal communications commission  fcc  has redefined the requirements for broadband and internet in general as a utility now at t and other major internet providers are lobbying against this action and are in-large able to delay the onset of this movement due to legacy thinking s grip on american culture and politics
for example those who cannot overcome the barrier of legacy thinking may not consider the privatization of clean drinking water as an issue this is partially due to the fact that access to water has become such a given fact of the matter to them for a person living in such circumstances it may be widely accepted to not concern themselves with drinking water because they have not needed to be concerned with it in the past additionally a person living within an area that does not need to worry about their water supply or the sanitation of their water supply is less likely to be concerned with the privatization of water
this notion can be examined through the thought experiment of  veil of ignorance  legacy thinking causes people to be particularly ignorant about the implications behind the  you get what you pay for  mentality applied to a life necessity by utilizing the  veil of ignorance  one can overcome the barrier of legacy thinking as it requires a person to imagine that they are unaware of their own circumstances allowing them to free themselves from externally imposed thoughts or widely accepted ideas
sts social construction
social constructions are human created ideas objects or events created by a series of choices and interactions these interactions have consequences that change the perception that different groups of people have on these constructs some examples of social construction include class race money and citizenship
the following also alludes to the notion that not everything is set a circumstance or result could potentially be one way or the other according to the article  what is social construction   by laura flores  social construction work is critical of the status quo social constructionists about x tend to hold that 
very often they go further and urge that 
in the past there have been viewpoints that were widely regarded as fact until being called to question due to the introduction of new knowledge such viewpoints include the past concept of a correlation between intelligence and the nature of a human s ethnicity or race  x may not be at all as it is 
an example of a social construction within science and technology can be found in the high-wheel bicycle a high-wheel bicycle is able to reach higher translational velocities than smaller bicycles by replacing the front wheel with a larger radius wheel one notable trade-off is the decreased stability leading to a greater risk of falling this trade-off resulted in many riders getting in accidents by losing balance while riding the bicycle or being thrown over the handle bars thus a technological innovation or progress caused some unintended and undesired consequences the bicycle was altered to fit within society s standards of vehicle safety in response to the social constructions that caused the bicycle to be designed in the first place
technoscience
technoscience is a subset of science technology and society studies that focuses on the inseparable connection between science and technology it states that fields are linked and grow together and scientific knowledge requires an infrastructure of technology in order to remain stationary or move forward both technological development and scientific discovery drive one another towards more advancement technoscience excels at shaping human thought and behavior by opening up new possibilities that gradually or quickly come to be perceived as necessities
gentle tyranny
gentle tyranny is a sociological concept that describes the unintended restrictions placed on a population through social constructs some hallmarks of gentle tyranny include restriction on choice and is typically very subtle the concept of gentle tyranny can be generally thought of as a projection of  hobson s choice  wherein the illusion of choice is presented but in reality the consumer  in the classic example  actually has none referencing a stable owner named thomas hobson  1544-1631  he infamously would offer customers the choice of buying the horse in the stall closest to the door or not purchasing one at all this  take it or leave it  attitude is endemic to gentle tyranny while gentle tyranny is not explicitly defined in sociological circles but more a general nomenclature for certain social and technological side effects including the unintended consequences that arise from new developments however gentle tyranny across all fronts describes the phenomena of  living with the enduring consequences of sociotechnical changes that occurred years or even generations ago 
examples of gentle tyranny can be found in virtually every social and technological sector some such as environmental pollution and  brown chemicals  do not involve an explicit choice by the affected population whatsoever the waste generated as a side effect of large-scale manufacturing is a prime example of this form of gentle tyranny while the population affected isn t forced to endure the reduction in air quality  ie they are free to move wear a respirator etc  these  take it or leave it  options are not necessarily feasible and place an unsolicited burden on the population gentle tyranny can also involve an explicit decision made by the public but under duress in a sense to avoid larger societal backlash while purchasing an automobile is completely voluntary the architecture of our society both literally and metaphorically presents serious consequences for certain people transit by other means is not always feasible particularly with workers whose commute would not otherwise be possible facing restricted travel or unemployment there is not a  choice  in the true sense whether or not to own an automobile
technosocial
 technological action is a social process  social factors and technology are intertwined so that they are dependent upon each other this includes the aspect that social political and economic factors are inherent in technology and that social structure influences what technologies are pursued in other words  technoscientific phenomena combined inextricably with social political  economic psychological phenomena so  technology  includes a spectrum of artifacts techniques organizations and systems  winner expands on this idea by saying  in the late twentieth century technology and society technology and culture technology and politics are by no means separate
