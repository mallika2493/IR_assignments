picturesque theorists argued that landscapes should be composed  like a picture   ie a landscape painting  with a foreground a middle ground and a background the theory was applied to landscape gardens in the eighteenth century and as nikolaus pevsner argued to the wider topic of regional planning in the twentieth century this produced the context theory that towns  the foreground  should be compact and urban that the surrounding countryside  the middle ground  should retain its agricultural character and that remote areas  the background  should remain as natural parks
modernist town planners lacked sympathy with picturesque context theory their firm belief that  form follows function  led to the prioritising of certain human needs over environmental considerations or deeper issues of meaning when planning a new road for example the emphasis was on traffic analysis and engineering rather than on the relationship between the new road and its environmental context
ian mcharg opposed modernist planning in his book design with nature he believed that new development should be preceded by the fullest possible analysis of the environmental context in which building would take place the highway planners who were in his view destroying the american landscape at that time were described as  highwaymen 
kenneth frampton put forward a context theory which he described as critical regionalism to help consider the relationship between new architecture and its context he believed that designers should make a critical response rather than a sentimental or copyist response to local design traditions
tom turner in chapter 3 of a book on landscape planning and environmental impact design  1998  argued for a broad approach to context theory based on an index of similarity identity and difference  the sid index    on different occasions a powerful case can be made for developments which are  similar to   identical with  or  different from  their surroundings   p.88
