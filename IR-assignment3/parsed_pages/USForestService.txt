since 1978 several presidents have directed the usfs to administer national monuments inside of preexisting national forests
the forest service also manages grey towers national historic site in milford pennsylvania the home and estate of its first chief gifford pinchot
fighting fires
in august 1944 to reduce the number of forest fires the forest service and the wartime advertising council began distributing fire education posters featuring a black bear the poster campaign was a success  the black bear would later be named  smokey bear  and would for decades be the  spokesbear  for the forest service smokey bear has appeared in innumerable tv commercials  his popular catch phrase  only you can prevent forest fires  is one of the most widely recognized slogans in the united states a recent study found that 95  of the people surveyed could complete the phrase when given the first few words
in september 2000 the departments of agriculture and the interior developed a plan to respond to the fires of 2000 to reduce the impacts of these wildland fires on rural communities and to ensure sufficient firefighting resources in the future the report is entitled  managing the impacts of wildfire on communities and the environment  a report to the president in response to the wildfires of 2000  the national fire plan for short the national fire plan continues to be an integral part of the forest service today the following are important operational features of the national fire plan 
in august 2014 tom vilsack the secretary of agriculture announced that the agency will have to put  400 to  500 million in wildfire prevention projects on hold because funding for firefighting is running low as the fiscal year ends the decision is meant to preserve resources for fighting active fires burning in california oregon washington and idaho politicians of both parties have indicated that they believe the current funding structure is broken but they have not agreed on steps to fix the funding allocation
budget
although part of the department of agriculture the forest service receives its budget through the subcommittee on appropriations interior environment and related agencies
popular culture
the us forest service achieved widespread awareness during the 1960s as it became the setting for the long running classic tv show lassie with storylines focusing on lassie s adventures with various forest rangers
the iconic collie s association with the forest service led to lassie receiving numerous awards and citations from the us senate and the department of agriculture and was partly responsible for a bill regarding soil and water pollution that was signed into law in early 1968 by president lyndon johnson which was dubbed by some as  the lassie program 
controversies
the history of the forest service has been fraught with controversy as various interests and national values have grappled with the appropriate management of the many resources within the forests these values and resources include grazing timber mining recreation wildlife habitat and wilderness because of continuing development elsewhere the large size of national forests have made them de facto wildlife reserves for a number of rare and common species in recent decades the importance of mature forest for the spotted owl and a number of other species led to great changes in timber harvest levels
in the 1990s the agency was involved in scandal when it illegally provided surplus military aircraft to private contractors for use as airtankers  see us forest service airtanker scandal 
another controversial issue is the policy on road building within the national forests in 1999 president clinton ordered a temporary moratorium on new road construction in the national forests to  assess their ecological economic and social values and to evaluate long-term options for their management  five and half years later the bush administration replaced this with a system where each state could petition the forest service to open forests in their territory to road building
some years the agency actually loses money on its timber sales
