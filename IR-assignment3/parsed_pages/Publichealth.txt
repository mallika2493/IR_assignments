public health - wikipedia
public health refers to  the science and art of preventing disease prolonging life and promoting health through organized efforts and informed choices of society organizations public and private communities and individuals  it is concerned with threats to health based on population health analysis the population in question can be as small as a handful of people or as large as all the inhabitants of several continents  for instance in the case of a pandemic  the dimensions of health can encompass  a state of complete physical mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity  as defined by the united nations  world health organization public health incorporates the interdisciplinary approaches of epidemiology biostatistics and health services environmental health community health behavioral health health economics public policy insurance medicine mental health and occupational safety and health are other important subfields
the focus of public health intervention is to improve health and quality of life through prevention and treatment of disease and other physical and mental health conditions this is done through surveillance of cases and health indicators and through promotion of healthy behaviors examples of common public health measures include promotion of hand washing breastfeeding delivery of vaccinations and distribution of condoms to control the spread of sexually transmitted diseases
modern public health practice requires multidisciplinary teams of public health workers and professionals including physicians specializing in public health community medicine infectious disease psychologists epidemiologists biostatisticians medical assistants or assistant medical officers public health nurses midwives medical microbiologists environmental health officers   public health inspectors pharmacists dentists dietitians and nutritionists veterinarians public health engineers public health lawyers sociologists community development workers communications experts bioethicists and others
there is a great disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed nations and developing nations in the developing world public health infrastructures are still forming


background
the focus of a public health intervention is to prevent and manage diseases injuries and other health conditions through surveillance of cases and the promotion of healthy behaviors communities and environments many diseases are preventable through simple non-medical methods for example research has shown that the simple act of hand washing with soap can prevent many contagious diseases in other cases treating a disease or controlling a pathogen can be vital to preventing its spread to others such as during an outbreak of infectious disease or contamination of food or water supplies public health communications programs vaccination programs and distribution of condoms are examples of common public health measures measures such as these have contributed greatly to the health of populations and increases in life expectancy
public health plays an important role in disease prevention efforts in both the developing world and in developed countries through local health systems and non-governmental organizations the world health organization  who  is the international agency that coordinates and acts on global public health issues most countries have their own government public health agencies sometimes known as ministries of health to respond to domestic health issues for example in the united states the front line of public health initiatives are state and local health departments the united states public health service  phs  led by the surgeon general of the united states and the centers for disease control and prevention headquartered in atlanta are involved with several international health activities in addition to their national duties in canada the public health agency of canada is the national agency responsible for public health emergency preparedness and response and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention the public health system in india is managed by the ministry of health   family welfare of the government of india with state owned health care facilities
current practice
public health programs
most governments recognize the importance of public health programs in reducing the incidence of disease disability and the effects of aging and other physical and mental health conditions although public health generally receives significantly less government funding compared with medicine public health programs providing vaccinations have made strides in promoting health including the eradication of smallpox a disease that plagued humanity for thousands of years
the world health organization  who  identifies core functions of public health programs including 
in particular public health surveillance programs can 
public health surveillance has led to the identification and prioritization of many public health issues facing the world today including hiv aids diabetes waterborne diseases zoonotic diseases and antibiotic resistance leading to the reemergence of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis antibiotic resistance also known as drug resistance was the theme of world health day 2011 although the prioritization of pressing public health issues is important laurie garrett argues that there are following consequences when foreign aid is funneled into disease-specific programs the importance of public health in general is disregarded this public health problem of stovepiping is thought to create a lack of funds to combat other existing diseases in a given country
for example the who reports that at least 220 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes its incidence is increasing rapidly and it is projected that the number of diabetes deaths will double by the year 2030 in a june 2010 editorial in the medical journal the lancet the authors opined that  the fact that type 2 diabetes a largely preventable disorder has reached epidemic proportion is a public health humiliation  the risk of type 2 diabetes is closely linked with the growing problem of obesity the who s latest estimates highlighted that globally approximately 1.5 billion adults were overweight in 2008 and nearly 43 million children under the age of five were overweight in 2010 the united states is the leading country with 30.6  of its population being obese mexico follows behind with 24.2  and the united kingdom with 23  once considered a problem in high-income countries it is now on the rise in low-income countries especially in urban settings many public health programs are increasingly dedicating attention and resources to the issue of obesity with objectives to address the underlying causes including healthy diet and physical exercise
some programs and policies associated with public health promotion and prevention can be controversial one such example is programs focusing on the prevention of hiv transmission through safe sex campaigns and needle-exchange programmes another is the control of tobacco smoking changing smoking behavior requires long-term strategies unlike the fight against communicable diseases which usually takes a shorter period for effects to be observed many nations have implemented major initiatives to cut smoking such as increased taxation and bans on smoking in some or all public places proponents argue by presenting evidence that smoking is one of the major killers and that therefore governments have a duty to reduce the death rate both through limiting passive  second-hand  smoking and by providing fewer opportunities for people to smoke opponents say that this undermines individual freedom and personal responsibility and worry that the state may be emboldened to remove more and more choice in the name of better population health overall
simultaneously while communicable diseases have historically ranged uppermost as a global health priority non-communicable diseases and the underlying behavior-related risk factors have been at the bottom this is changing however as illustrated by the united nations hosting its first general assembly special summit on the issue of non-communicable diseases in september 2011
many health problems are due to maladaptive personal behaviors from an evolutionary psychology perspective over consumption of novel substances that are harmful is due to the activation of an evolved reward system for substances such as drugs tobacco alcohol refined salt fat and carbohydrates new technologies such as modern transportation also cause reduced physical activity research has found that behavior is more effectively changed by taking evolutionary motivations into consideration instead of only presenting information about health effects thus the increased use of soap and hand-washing to prevent diarrhea is much more effectively promoted if its lack of use is associated with the emotion of disgust disgust is an evolved system for avoiding contact with substances that spread infectious diseases examples might include films that show how fecal matter contaminates food the marketing industry has long known the importance of associating products with high status and attractiveness to others conversely it has been argued that emphasizing the harmful and undesirable effects of tobacco smoking on other persons and imposing smoking bans in public places have been particularly effective in reducing tobacco smoking
applications in health care
as well as seeking to improve population health through the implementation of specific population-level interventions public health contributes to medical care by identifying and assessing population needs for health care services including 
implementing effective improvement strategies
to improve public health one important strategy is to promote modern medicine and scientific neutrality to drive the public health policy and campaign which is recommended by armanda solorzana through a case study of the rockefeller foundation s hookworm campaign in mexico in the 1920s soloranza argues that public health policy can t concern only politics or economics political concerns can lead government officials to hide the real numbers of people affected by disease in their regions such as upcoming elections therefore scientific neutrality in making public health policy is critical  it can ensure treatment needs are met regardless of political and economic conditions
the history of public health care clearly shows the global effort to improve health care for all however in modern-day medicine real measurable change has not been clearly seen and critics argue that this lack of improvement is due to ineffective methods that are being implemented as argued by paul e farmer structural interventions could possibly have a large impact and yet there are numerous problems as to why this strategy has yet to be incorporated into the health system one of the main reasons that he suggests could be the fact that physicians are not properly trained to carry out structural interventions meaning that the ground level health care professionals cannot implement these improvements while structural interventions can not be the only area for improvement the lack of coordination between socioeconomic factors and health care for the poor could be counterproductive and end up causing greater inequity between the health care services received by the rich and by the poor unless health care is no longer treated as a commodity global public health can ultimately not be achieved this being the case without changing the way in which health care is delivered to those who have less access to it the universal goal of public health care cannot be achieved
public health 2.0
public health 2.0 is a movement within public health that aims to make the field more accessible to the general public and more user-driven the term is used in three senses in the first sense  public health 2.0  is similar to  health 2.0  and describes the ways in which traditional public health practitioners and institutions are reaching out  or could reach out  to the public through social media and health blogs
in the second sense  public health 2.0  describes public health research that uses data gathered from social networking sites search engine queries cell phones or other technologies a recent example is the proposal of statistical framework that utilizes online user-generated content  from social media or search engine queries  to estimate the impact of an influenza vaccination campaign in the uk
in the third sense  public health 2.0  is used to describe public health activities that are completely user-driven an example is the collection and sharing of information about environmental radiation levels after the march 2011 tsunami in japan in all cases public health 2.0 draws on ideas from web 2.0 such as crowdsourcing information sharing and user-centred design while many individual healthcare providers have started making their own personal contributions to  public health 2.0  through personal blogs social profiles and websites other larger organizations such as the american heart association  aha  and united medical education  ume  have a larger team of employees centered around online driven health education research and training these private organizations recognize the need for free and easy to access health materials often building libraries of educational articles
developing countries
there is a great disparity in access to health care and public health initiatives between developed nations and developing nations in the developing world public health infrastructures are still forming there may not be enough trained health workers or monetary resources to provide even a basic level of medical care and disease prevention as a result a large majority of disease and mortality in the developing world results from and contributes to extreme poverty for example many african governments spend less than us 10 per person per year on health care while in the united states the federal government spent approximately us 4,500 per capita in 2000 however expenditures on health care should not be confused with spending on public health public health measures may not generally be considered  health care  in the strictest sense for example mandating the use of seat belts in cars can save countless lives and contribute to the health of a population but typically money spent enforcing this rule would not count as money spent on health care
large parts of the developing world remained plagued by largely preventable or treatable infectious diseases and poor maternal and child health exacerbated by malnutrition and poverty the who reports that a lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life contributes to over a million avoidable child deaths each year intermittent preventive therapy aimed at treating and preventing malaria episodes among pregnant women and young children is one public health measure in endemic countries
each day brings new front-page headlines about public health  emerging infectious diseases such as sars rapidly making its way from china  see public health in china  to canada the united states and other geographically distant countries  reducing inequities in health care access through publicly funded health insurance programs  the hiv aids pandemic and its spread from certain high-risk groups to the general population in many countries such as in south africa  the increase of childhood obesity and the concomitant increase in type ii diabetes among children  the social economic and health effects of adolescent pregnancy  and the public health challenges related to natural disasters such as the 2004 indian ocean tsunami 2005 s hurricane katrina in the united states and the 2010 haiti earthquake
since the 1980s the growing field of population health has broadened the focus of public health from individual behaviors and risk factors to population-level issues such as inequality poverty and education modern public health is often concerned with addressing determinants of health across a population there is a recognition that our health is affected by many factors including where we live genetics our income our educational status and our social relationships  these are known as  social determinants of health  a social gradient in health runs through society the poorest generally suffer the worst health but even the middle classes will generally have worse health outcomes than those of a higher social stratum the new public health advocates for population-based policies that improve health in an equitable manner
sustainable development goals
to address current and future challenges in addressing health issues in the world the united nations have developed the sustainable development goals 2015 building off of the millennium development goals of 2000 to be completed by 2030 these goals in their entirety encompass the entire spectrum of development across nations however goals 1-6 directly address health disparities primarily in developing countries these six goals address key issues in global public health  poverty hunger and food security health education gender equality and women s empowerment and water and sanitation public health officials can use these goals to set their own agenda and plan for smaller scale initiatives for their organizations these goals hope to lessen the burden of disease and inequality faced by developing countries and lead to a healthier future
the links between the various sustainable development goals and public health are numerous and well established 
education and training
education and training of public health professionals is available throughout the world in schools of public health medical schools veterinary schools schools of nursing and schools of public affairs the training typically requires a university degree with a focus on core disciplines of biostatistics epidemiology health services administration health policy health education behavioral science and environmental health in the global context the field of public health education has evolved enormously in recent decades supported by institutions such as the world health organization and the world bank among others operational structures are formulated by strategic principles with educational and career pathways guided by competency frameworks all requiring modulation according to local national and global realities it is critically important for the health of populations that nations assess their public health human resource needs and develop their ability to deliver this capacity and not depend on other countries to supply it
schools of public health - a us perspective
in the united states the welch-rose report of 1915 has been viewed as the basis for the critical movement in the history of the institutional schism between public health and medicine because it led to the establishment of schools of public health supported by the rockefeller foundation the report was authored by william welch founding dean of the johns hopkins bloomberg school of public health and wickliffe rose of the rockefeller foundation the report focused more on research than practical education some have blamed the rockefeller foundation s 1916 decision to support the establishment of schools of public health for creating the schism between public health and medicine and legitimizing the rift between medicine s laboratory investigation of the mechanisms of disease and public health s nonclinical concern with environmental and social influences on health and wellness
even though schools of public health had already been established in canada europe and north africa the united states had still maintained the traditional system of housing faculties of public health within their medical institutions a  25,000 donation from businessman samuel zemurray instituted the school of public health and tropical medicine at tulane university in 1912 conferring its first doctor of public health degree in 1914 the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health became an independent degree-granting institution for research and training in public health and the largest public health training facility in the united states when it was founded in 1916 by 1922 schools of public health were established at columbia harvard and yale on the hopkins model by 1999 there were twenty nine schools of public health in the us enrolling around fifteen thousand students
over the years the types of students and training provided have also changed in the beginning students who enrolled in public health schools typically had already obtained a medical degree  public health school training was largely a second degree for medical professionals however in 1978 69  of american students enrolled in public health schools had only a bachelor s degree
degrees in public health
schools of public health offer a variety of degrees which generally fall into two categories  professional or academic the two major postgraduate degrees are the master of public health  mph  or the master of science in public health  msph  doctoral studies in this field include doctor of public health  drph  and doctor of philosophy  phd  in a subspeciality of greater public health disciplines drph is regarded as a professional leadership degree and phd as more of an academic degree
professional degrees are oriented towards practice in public health settings the master of public health doctor of public health doctor of health science  dhsc  and the master of health care administration are examples of degrees which are geared towards people who want careers as practitioners of public health in health departments managed care and community-based organizations hospitals and consulting firms among others master of public health degrees broadly fall into two categories those that put more emphasis on an understanding of epidemiology and statistics as the scientific basis of public health practice and those that include a more eclectic range of methodologies a master of science of public health is similar to an mph but is considered an academic degree  as opposed to a professional degree  and places more emphasis on scientific methods and research the same distinction can be made between the drph and the dhsc the drph is considered a professional degree and the dhsc is an academic degree
academic degrees are more oriented towards those with interests in the scientific basis of public health and preventive medicine who wish to pursue careers in research university teaching in graduate programs policy analysis and development and other high-level public health positions examples of academic degrees are the master of science doctor of philosophy doctor of science  scd  and doctor of health science  dhsc  the doctoral programs are distinct from the mph and other professional programs by the addition of advanced coursework and the nature and scope of a dissertation research project
in the united states the association of schools of public health represents council on education for public health  ceph  accredited schools of public health delta omega is the honor society for graduate studies in public health the society was founded in 1924 at the johns hopkins school of hygiene and public health currently there are approximately 68 chapters throughout the united states and puerto rico
history
early history
public health has early roots in antiquity from the beginnings of human civilization it was recognized that polluted water and lack of proper waste disposal spread communicable diseases  theory of miasma  early religions attempted to regulate behavior that specifically related to health from types of food eaten to regulating certain indulgent behaviors such as drinking alcohol or sexual relations leaders were responsible for the health of their subjects to ensure social stability prosperity and maintain order
by roman times it was well understood that proper diversion of human waste was a necessary tenet of public health in urban areas the ancient chinese medical doctors developed the practice of variolation following a smallpox epidemic around 1000 bc an individual without the disease could gain some measure of immunity against it by inhaling the dried crusts that formed around lesions of infected individuals also children were protected by inoculating a scratch on their forearms with the pus from a lesion
in 1485 the republic of venice established a permanent court of supervisors of health with special attention to the prevention of the spread of epidemics in the territory from abroad the three supervisors were initially appointed by the venetian senate in 1537 it was assumed by the grand council and in 1556 added two judges with the task of control on behalf of the republic the efforts of the supervisors
however according to michel foucault the plague model of governmentality was later controverted by the cholera model a cholera pandemic devastated europe between 1829 and 1851 and was first fought by the use of what foucault called  social medicine  which focused on flux circulation of air location of cemeteries etc all those concerns born of the miasma theory of disease were mixed with urbanistic concerns for the management of populations which foucault designated as the concept of  biopower  the german conceptualized this in the polizeiwissenschaft   police science  
modern public health
the 18th century saw rapid growth in voluntary hospitals in england the latter part of the century brought the establishment of the basic pattern of improvements in public health over the next two centuries  a social evil was identified private philanthropists brought attention to it and changing public opinion led to government action
the practice of vaccination became prevalent in the 1800s following the pioneering work of edward jenner in treating smallpox james lind s discovery of the causes of scurvy amongst sailors and its mitigation via the introduction of fruit on lengthy voyages was published in 1754 and led to the adoption of this idea by the royal navy efforts were also made to promulgate health matters to the broader public  in 1752 the british physician sir john pringle published observations on the diseases of the army in camp and garrison in which he advocated for the importance of adequate ventilation in the military barracks and the provision of latrines for the soldiers
with the onset of the industrial revolution living standards amongst the working population began to worsen with cramped and unsanitary urban conditions in the first four decades of the 19th century alone london s population doubled and even greater growth rates were recorded in the new industrial towns such as leeds and manchester this rapid urbanisation exacerbated the spread of disease in the large conurbations that built up around the workhouses and factories these settlements were cramped and primitive with no organized sanitation disease was inevitable and its incubation in these areas was encouraged by the poor lifestyle of the inhabitants unavailable housing led to the rapid growth of slums and the per capita death rate began to rise alarmingly almost doubling in birmingham and liverpool thomas malthus warned of the dangers of overpopulation in 1798 his ideas as well as those of jeremy bentham became very influential in government circles in the early years of the 19th century
the first attempts at sanitary reform and the establishment of public health institutions were made in the 1840s thomas southwood smith physician at the london fever hospital began to write papers on the importance of public health and was one of the first physicians brought in to give evidence before the poor law commission in the 1830s along with neil arnott and james phillips kay smith advised the government on the importance of quarantine and sanitary improvement for limiting the spread of infectious diseases such as cholera and yellow fever
the poor law commission reported in 1838 that  the expenditures necessary to the adoption and maintenance of measures of prevention would ultimately amount to less than the cost of the disease now constantly engendered  it recommended the implementation of large scale government engineering projects to alleviate the conditions that allowed for the propagation of disease the health of towns association was formed in exeter on 11 december 1844 and vigorously campaigned for the development of public health in the united kingdom its formation followed the 1843 establishment of the health of towns commission chaired by sir edwin chadwick which produced a series of reports on poor and insanitary conditions in british cities
these national and local movements led to the public health act finally passed in 1848 it aimed to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in england and wales by placing the supply of water sewerage drainage cleansing and paving under a single local body with the general board of health as a central authority the act was passed by the liberal government of lord john russell in response to the urging of edwin chadwick chadwick s seminal report on the sanitary condition of the labouring population was published in 1842 and was followed up with a supplementary report a year later
vaccination for various diseases was made compulsory in the united kingdom in 1851 and by 1871 legislation required a comprehensive system of registration run by appointed vaccination officers
further interventions were made by a series of subsequent public health acts notably the 1875 act reforms included latrinization the building of sewers the regular collection of garbage followed by incineration or disposal in a landfill the provision of clean water and the draining of standing water to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes
the infectious disease  notification  act 1889 mandated the reporting of infectious diseases to the local sanitary authority which could then pursue measures such as the removal of the patient to hospital and the disinfection of homes and properties
in the us the first public health organization based on a state health department and local boards of health was founded in new york city in 1866
the science of epidemiology was founded by john snow s identification of a polluted public water well as the source of an 1854 cholera outbreak in london dr snow believed in the germ theory of disease as opposed to the prevailing miasma theory he first publicized his theory in an essay on the mode of communication of cholera in 1849 followed by a more detailed treatise in 1855 incorporating the results of his investigation of the role of the water supply in the soho epidemic of 1854
by talking to local residents  with the help of reverend henry whitehead  he identified the source of the outbreak as the public water pump on broad street  now broadwick street  although snow s chemical and microscope examination of a water sample from the broad street pump did not conclusively prove its danger his studies of the pattern of the disease were convincing enough to persuade the local council to disable the well pump by removing its handle
snow later used a dot map to illustrate the cluster of cholera cases around the pump he also used statistics to illustrate the connection between the quality of the water source and cholera cases he showed that the southwark and vauxhall waterworks company was taking water from sewage-polluted sections of the thames and delivering the water to homes leading to an increased incidence of cholera snow s study was a major event in the history of public health and geography it is regarded as the founding event of the science of epidemiology
with the pioneering work in bacteriology of french chemist louis pasteur and german scientist robert koch methods for isolating the bacteria responsible for a given disease and vaccines for remedy were developed at the turn of the 20th century british physician ronald ross identified the mosquito as the carrier of malaria and laid the foundations for combating the disease joseph lister revolutionized surgery by the introduction of antiseptic surgery to eliminate infection french epidemiologist paul-louis simond proved that plague was carried by fleas on the back of rats and the americans walter reed and james carroll demonstrated that mosquitoes carry the virus responsible for yellow fever
with onset of the epidemiological transition and as the prevalence of infectious diseases decreased through the 20th century public health began to put more focus on chronic diseases such as cancer and heart disease previous efforts in many developed countries had already led to dramatic reductions in the infant mortality rate using preventative methods in britain the infant mortality rate fell from over 15  in 1870 to 7  by 1930
country examples
france 1871-1914 followed well behind bismarckian germany as well as great britain in developing the welfare state including public health tuberculosis was the most dreaded disease of the day especially striking young people in their 20s germany set up vigorous measures of public hygiene and public sanatoria but france let private physicians handle the problem which left it with a much higher death rate the french medical profession jealously guarded its prerogatives and public health activists were not as well organized or as influential as in germany britain or the united states for example there was a long battle over a public health law which began in the 1880s as a campaign to reorganize the nation s health services to require the registration of infectious diseases to mandate quarantines and to improve the deficient health and housing legislation of 1850 however the reformers met opposition from bureaucrats politicians and physicians because it was so threatening to so many interests the proposal was debated and postponed for 20 years before becoming law in 1902 success finally came when the government realized that contagious diseases had a national security impact in weakening military recruits and keeping the population population growth rate well below germany s
most of the public health activity in the united states took place at the municipal level before the mid-20th century there was some activity at the national and state level as well
in the united states public health worker sara josephine baker md established many programs to help the poor in new york city keep their infants healthy leading teams of nurses into the crowded neighborhoods of hell s kitchen and teaching mothers how to dress feed and bathe their babies
another key pioneer of public health in the us was lillian wald who founded the henry street settlement house in new york the visiting nurse service of new york was a significant organization for bringing health care to the urban poor
dramatic increases in average life span in the late 19th century and 20th century is widely credited to public health achievements such as vaccination programs and control of many infectious diseases including polio diphtheria yellow fever and smallpox  effective health and safety policies such as road traffic safety and occupational safety  improved family planning  tobacco control measures  and programs designed to decrease non-communicable diseases by acting on known risk factors such as a person s background lifestyle and environment
another major public health improvement was the decline in the  urban penalty  brought about by improvements in sanitation these improvements included chlorination of drinking water filtration and sewage treatment which led to the decline in deaths caused by infectious waterborne diseases such as cholera and intestinal diseases the federal office of indian affairs  oia  operated a large-scale field nursing program field nurses targeted native women for health education emphasizing personal hygiene and infant care and nutrition
public health issues were important for the spanish empire during the colonial era epidemic disease was the main factor in the decline of indigenous populations in the era immediately following the sixteenth-century conquest era and was a problem during the colonial era the spanish crown took steps in eighteenth-century mexico to bring in regulations to make populations healthier in the late nineteenth century mexico was in the process of modernization and public health issues were again tackled from a scientific point of view even during the mexican revolution  1910 20  public health was an important concern with a text on hygiene published in 1916 during the mexican revolution feminist and trained nurse elena arizmendi mejia founded the neutral white cross treating wounded soldiers no matter for what faction they fought in the post-revolutionary period after 1920 improved public health was a revolutionary goal of the mexican government
public health was important elsewhere in latin america in consolidating state power and integrating marginalized populations into the nation-state in colombia public health was a means for creating and implementing ideas of citizenship in bolivia the push came after their 1952 revolution
